1
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,501
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

2
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,047
the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,387
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:23,058
She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,063
And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,984
What was your response?
I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,362
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

8
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,907
Those were your words, according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,577
If they say so.

10
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,621
I really don't remember. 
I was upset.

11
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,332
What happened after you argued with your wife?

12
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,252
She packed a bag.

13
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,590
She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,344
Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

15
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,681
whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.

16
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,185
Did you follow her?

17
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,605
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:14,193
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,278
I parked in the turnout...

20
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,988
and waited.

21
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,865
With what intention?

22
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,909
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,954
I was confused... drunk.

24
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,959
I think... mostly I
wanted to scare them.

25
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,504
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

26
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,798
No, I was sobering up.

27
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,677
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

28
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,847
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

29
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,141
I've been very clear on this point.

30
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:50,354
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

31
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,148
and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

32
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,484
riddled with .38-caliber bullets.

33
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,031
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

34
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,950
Yes, it does.

35
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,328
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

36
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,580
before the murders took place.

37
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,999
That's very convenient.

38
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,876
It's the truth.

39
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,839
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

40
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:22,135
so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

41
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,764
taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

42
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,850
And that also...

43
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,729
is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

44
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,149
Since I am innocent of this crime...

45
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:41,029
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

46
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,217
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've heard all the evidence.

47
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,263
We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

48
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,349
Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

49
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,519
A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

50
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,271
And most of all...

51
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,566
we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

52
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,776
lying dead in each other's arms.

53
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,572
They had sinned.

54
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,326
But was their crime so great...

55
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,786
as to merit a death sentence?

56
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,289
While you think about that...

57
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,542
think about this:

58
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,130
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

59
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,051
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

60
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,054
That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

61
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,263
No.

62
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,432
This was revenge...

63
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,269
of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

64
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,855
Four bullets per victim.

65
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,316
Not six shots fired, but eight.

66
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,445
That means that he fired
the gun empty...

67
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,448
and then stopped to reload...

68
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,284
so that he could shoot
each of them again.

69
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,079
An extra bullet per lover...

70
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,623
right in the head.

71
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:22,923
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

72
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,467
It chills my blood just to look at you.

73
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,138
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

74
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:34,643
I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

75
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,521
one for each of your victims. So be it!

76
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,839
Sit.

77
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,179
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

78
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,350
- Yes, sir.
- You feel you've been rehabilitated?

79
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,353
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

80
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,481
I mean, I learned my lesson.

81
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,986
I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

82
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,575
I'm no longer a danger to society.

83
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,743
That's God's honest truth.

84
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,364
Hey, Red.

85
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,866
How'd it go?

86
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,243
Same old shit, different day.

87
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,370
Yeah, I know how you feel.

88
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,581
I'm up for rejection next week.

89
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,876
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

90
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,377
It happens.

91
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,004
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

92
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,508
Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

93
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,717
- Four!
- Five!

94
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,263
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

95
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,265
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

96
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,602
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...

97
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,231
a bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.

98
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,566
Damn near anything within reason.

99
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,487
Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

100
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,368
So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...

101
00:08:56,577 --> 00:09:00,121
and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

102
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,624
I told him, "No problem."

103
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:26,314
Officers to main gate.
Officers to main gate.

104
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,526
Secure main gate.

105
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,668
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

106
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,755
in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

107
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,176
On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.

108
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,387
Good work for a man so young.

109
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,269
Hey, Red.

110
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,390
You speak English, butt-steak?

111
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,476
You follow this officer.

112
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:01,493
I never seen such a sorry-looking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

113
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,329
Hey, fish! Come over here!

114
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,978
Taking bets today, Red?

115
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,064
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

116
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,941
Smokes. Put me down for two.

117
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,068
All right, who's your horse?

118
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,028
That little sack of shit.

119
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,908
- Eighth. He'll be first.
- Bullshit! I'll take that action.

120
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,327
You're out some smokes, son.

121
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,287
If you're so smart, you call it.

122
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,582
I'll take the chubby fat-ass there.

123
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,377
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

124
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,298
Fresh fish today!

125
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,509
We're reeling them in!

126
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,847
I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.

127
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,308
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

128
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,769
That was my first impression of the man.

129
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,396
What do you say?

130
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,899
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

131
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,235
That guy? Never happen.

132
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,696
- Ten cigarettes.
- That's a rich bet.

133
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,990
Who's going to prove me wrong?

134
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,992
Heywood? Jigger?

135
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,577
Skeets?

136
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,120
Floyd!

137
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,123
Four brave souls.

138
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,084
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

139
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,588
All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.

140
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,151
Turn to the right!

141
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,611
Eyes front.

142
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,293
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

143
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,587
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

144
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,006
You are convicted felons.

145
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,300
That's why they've sent you to me.

146
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,260
Rule number one:

147
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,970
No blasphemy.

148
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,891
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

149
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,309
The other rules...

150
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,813
you'll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

151
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,231
When do we eat?

152
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,950
You eat when we say you eat.

153
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,411
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

154
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,456
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

155
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,709
On your feet.

156
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,670
I believe in two things:

157
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,339
Discipline and the Bible.

158
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,925
Here, you'll receive both.

159
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,845
Put your trust in the Lord.

160
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,681
Your ass belongs to me.

161
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,434
Welcome to Shawshank.

162
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,941
Unhook them.

163
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,781
Turn around.

164
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,039
That's enough.

165
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,959
Move to the end of the cage.

166
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,462
Turn around. Delouse him.

167
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,883
Turn around.

168
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,430
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

169
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,973
Next man up!

170
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,978
To the right. Right. Right.

171
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,771
Left.

172
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,984
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

173
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,529
They march you in
naked as the day you were born...

174
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,533
skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.

175
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,620
And when they put you in that cell...

176
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,164
and those bars slam home...

177
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,833
that's when you know it's for real.

178
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,420
Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.

179
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:27,008
Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.

180
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,512
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

181
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,766
Somebody always breaks down crying.

182
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,935
Happens every time.

183
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,646
The only question is...

184
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,606
who's it going to be?

185
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,944
It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.

186
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,697
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

187
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,375
Lights out!

188
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,231
I remember my first night.

189
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,985
Seems like a long time ago.

190
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,823
Hey, fish.

191
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,659
Fish, fish.

192
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,996
What are you, scared of the dark?

193
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,042
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

194
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,671
Piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop.

195
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,846
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Keep it down.

196
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,266
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

197
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,519
And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.

198
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,522
Hey, Fat Ass.

199
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,358
Fat Ass!

200
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,278
Talk to me, boy.

201
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,656
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

202
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,826
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

203
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,953
This place ain't so bad.

204
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,621
Tell you what...

205
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,959
I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

206
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,546
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

207
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,715
love to make your acquaintance.

208
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,427
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

209
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,720
God!

210
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,805
I don't belong here!

211
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,808
- We have a winner!
- I want to go home!

212
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,770
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

213
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,276
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

214
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,653
I don't belong here.

215
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,240
I want to go home!

216
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,451
I want my mother!

217
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,828
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

218
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,251
What the Christ is this horseshit?

219
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,545
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

220
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,973
You'll tell him with
my baton up your ass!

221
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:13,174
You gotta let me out!

222
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,803
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

223
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,014
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

224
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,557
Not me!

225
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,102
I won't count to three. Not even to one.

226
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,354
You shut up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

227
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,565
- Shut up, man. Shut up!
- There's been a mistake.

228
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,985
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

229
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,487
Open that cell.

230
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,949
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

231
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,458
Son of a bitch!

232
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,715
Captain, take it easy!

233
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,366
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

234
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,995
I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

235
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,831
Every last motherfucker in here.

236
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,921
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

237
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,899
His first night in the joint,
Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

238
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,110
He never made a sound.

239
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,794
Tier 3 north, clear count!

240
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,756
- Tier 2 north, clear.
- Tier 2 south, clear.

241
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,383
Tier 3 south, clear.

242
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,638
- Tier 1 south, clear.
- Tier 4 south, clear.

243
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,806
Prepare to roll out.

244
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,895
Roll out!

245
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,993
Are you going to eat that?

246
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,912
I hadn't planned on it.

247
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,206
Do you mind?

248
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,216
That's nice and ripe.

249
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,022
Jake says thank you.

250
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,692
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

251
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,488
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

252
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,408
Oh, no! Here he comes.

253
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,204
Morning, fellas.

254
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,373
Fine morning, isn't it?

255
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,917
You know why it's a fine morning,
don't you?

256
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,420
Send them down.
I want them lined up...

257
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,256
just like a pretty little
chorus line.

258
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,592
Look at that.

259
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,262
- I can't stand this guy.
- Oh, Lord!

260
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,432
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

261
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,975
Smell my ass!

262
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,186
After he smells mine.

263
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,315
That's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

264
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,360
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

265
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,571
I owe that boy a big kiss
when I see him.

266
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,950
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

267
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,786
Hey, Tyrell.

268
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,121
You pull infirmary duty this week?

269
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,665
How's my horse doing anyway?

270
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,209
Dead.

271
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,253
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

272
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,631
Doc had gone home for the night.

273
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,425
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

274
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,095
By then, there wasn't nothing
we could do.

275
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,685
What was his name?

276
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,315
What'd you say?

277
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,653
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

278
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,073
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

279
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,202
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

280
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,268
Anybody come at you yet?

281
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,230
Anybody get to you yet?

282
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,443
Hey, we all need friends in here.

283
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,403
I could be a friend to you.

284
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,038
Hard to get.

285
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,625
I like that.

286
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,802
Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.

287
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,096
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

288
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,391
trying to adapt
to life on the inside.

289
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,312
Wasn't until a month went by
before he opened his mouth...

290
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,898
to say more than two words
to somebody.

291
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,650
As it turned out...

292
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,986
that somebody was me.

293
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,538
I'm Andy Dufresne.

294
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,500
Wife-killing banker.

295
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,086
Why'd you do it?

296
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,589
I didn't, since you ask.

297
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,008
You're going to fit right in.

298
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,928
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

299
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,765
- What you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

300
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,354
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

301
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,149
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

302
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,817
What do you think?

303
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,279
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

304
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,200
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

305
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,454
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

306
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,249
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

307
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,251
A rock hammer.

308
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,295
- What is it and why?
- What do you care?

309
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,341
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

310
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,969
But a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

311
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,972
Fair enough.

312
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,016
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

313
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,561
- Looks like a miniature pickax.
- Pickax?

314
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,979
For rocks.

315
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,816
Quartz?

316
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,198
And some mica, shale...

317
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,701
limestone.

318
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,077
So?

319
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,830
So I'm a rock hound.

320
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,375
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again.

321
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,795
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

322
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,840
No, I have no enemies here.

323
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,342
No? Wait a while.

324
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,554
Word gets around.

325
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,724
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

326
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,893
Especially Bogs.

327
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,356
Don't suppose it would help if I
told them I'm not homosexual.

328
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,983
Neither are they.

329
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,653
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

330
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,537
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

331
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,291
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

332
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,252
- Thanks for the advice.
- Well, that's free.

333
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,546
You understand my concern.

334
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,382
If there's trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer.

335
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:20,346
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

336
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,890
What did I miss? What's so funny?

337
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,018
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

338
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,064
What's an item like this usually go for?

339
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,775
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

340
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,736
My normal markup's 20 percent.

341
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,322
But this is a specialty item.

342
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:42,993
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

343
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,536
Ten it is.

344
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,290
Waste of money, if you ask me.

345
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,875
Why's that?

346
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,296
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

347
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,883
They find it, you're going to lose it.

348
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,177
If they catch you, you don't know me.

349
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,596
Mention my name,
we never do business again.

350
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,225
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

351
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,602
I understand.

352
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,148
Thank you, Mr... Red.

353
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,192
Name's Red.

354
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,278
Why do they call you that?

355
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,034
Maybe it's because I'm lrish.

356
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,087
I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.

357
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,382
He had a quiet way about him...

358
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,886
a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.

359
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,680
He strolled...

360
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:49,101
like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

361
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,981
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

362
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,152
I think it would be fair to say...

363
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,654
I liked Andy from the start.

364
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,993
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

365
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,832
Move it! Come on, move it!

366
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,337
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

367
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,976
Keep it moving.

368
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,023
Red.

369
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,960
Andy was right.

370
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,421
I finally got the joke.

371
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,132
It would take a man about 600 years...

372
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,802
to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.

373
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,016
- Book?
- Not today.

374
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,066
- Book?
- No.

375
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,574
Delivery for Dufresne.

376
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,878
Book?

377
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,844
Dufresne, here's your book.

378
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,100
Thanks.

379
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:03,068
We're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

380
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,940
This will blind you.

381
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,693
Honey, hush.

382
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,207
That's it. You fight!

383
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,876
Better that way.

384
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,220
I wish I could tell you
Andy fought the good fight...

385
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,431
and the Sisters let him be.

386
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,850
I wish I could tell you that...

387
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,020
but prison is no fairy-tale world.

388
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,106
He never said who did it.

389
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,942
But we all knew.

390
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,282
Things went on like that for a while.

391
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,202
Prison life consists of routine...

392
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,412
and then more routine.

393
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,460
Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.

394
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,755
The Sisters kept at him.

395
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,049
Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.

396
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,759
Sometimes not.

397
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,096
And that's how it went for Andy.

398
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,431
That was his routine.

399
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,727
I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.

400
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,564
And I also believe
if things had gone on that way...

401
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,359
this place would have
got the best of him.

402
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,904
But then, in the spring of 1949...

403
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,031
the powers that be decided:

404
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,576
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

405
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,955
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

406
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,124
As you know...

407
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:26,420
special detail carries with it
special privileges.

408
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,047
It was outdoor detail...

409
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,719
and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.

410
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,262
Stay in line there.

411
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,640
More than 100 men
volunteered for the job.

412
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,939
Wallace E. Unger.

413
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,775
Ellis Redding.

414
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,569
Wouldn't you know it?

415
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,281
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

416
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,491
Andrew Dufresne.

417
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,828
It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.

418
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,789
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

419
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,460
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

420
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,253
I say, "Yeah?"

421
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:12,132
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

422
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:16,261
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I'm not. He was an asshole.

423
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,638
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

424
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,141
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

425
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,479
"He died a rich man." Oil wells and shit.
Close to a million bucks.

426
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,023
A million bucks?

427
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:32,819
- Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
- You going to see any of that?

428
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,198
Thirty-five thousand.
That's what he left me.

429
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,158
- Dollars?
- Yep.

430
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,328
That's great!
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

431
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,829
Isn't it?

432
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,957
Dumb shit, what do you think
the government will do to me?

433
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,502
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

434
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,629
Poor Byron.

435
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,674
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

436
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,177
Some people really got it awful.

437
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,804
Andy, are you nuts?

438
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,889
Keep your eyes on your mop, man!

439
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,059
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

440
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,062
Yeah, maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

441
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,439
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

442
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,401
maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

443
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,322
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

444
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,658
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

445
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,870
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

446
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,708
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

447
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,461
Some brother. Shit!

448
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,801
Mr. Hadley...

449
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,053
do you trust your wife?

450
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,140
Oh, that's funny.

451
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,351
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

452
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,855
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?

453
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,401
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

454
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,694
He'll push him off!

455
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,737
If you trust her, you can keep...

456
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,322
that 35,000.

457
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,243
- What did you say?
- Thirty-five thousand.

458
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,411
All of it.

459
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,706
- Every penny.
- You better start making sense.

460
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,250
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

461
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:14,337
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

462
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,923
- Bullshit. Tax-free?
- Tax-free.

463
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,092
IRS can't touch one cent.

464
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,928
You're that smart banker
what killed his wife.

465
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,557
Why should I believe you?
So I can end up in here with you?

466
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,602
It's legal. Ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

467
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,856
I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

468
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,735
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

469
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,322
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set it up for you.

470
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,115
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

471
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,576
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

472
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,496
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

473
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,790
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

474
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,751
nearly free of charge.

475
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:57,297
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

476
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,799
"Coworkers." That's rich!

477
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,136
A man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

478
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,806
if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

479
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,266
sir.

480
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,147
What are you jimmies staring at?

481
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,941
Let's go! Work!

482
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,369
And that's how it came to pass...

483
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,247
that on the second-to-last
day of the job...

484
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:35,001
the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...

485
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,338
wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

486
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:44,010
drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

487
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,514
that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

488
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,141
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

489
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:55,814
The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

490
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,403
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

491
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,198
We could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

492
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,243
We were the lords of all creation.

493
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,412
As for Andy...

494
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,290
he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

495
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,001
a strange little smile on his face...

496
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,420
watching us drink his beer.

497
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,887
Want a cold one?

498
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,516
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

499
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,565
You could argue he'd done it
to curry favor with the guards.

500
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:43,069
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

501
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,863
Me?

502
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,866
I think he did it
just to feel normal again...

503
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,535
if only for a short while.

504
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,247
King me.

505
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,752
- Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
- What?

506
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,712
Civilized. Strategic.

507
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,382
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.

508
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,426
Let me teach you someday.

509
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:08,928
Sure.

510
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,139
We could get a board together.

511
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,434
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

512
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:18,646
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

513
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,150
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.
What do you think?

514
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,152
I think it'll take years.

515
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,905
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

516
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,074
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

517
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,117
Pebbles, mostly.

518
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,249
We're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

519
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,668
Yeah, I guess.

520
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,837
Can I ask you something?

521
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,757
Why'd you do it?

522
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,551
I'm innocent, Red.

523
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,804
Just like everybody else here.

524
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,684
What are you in for?

525
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,564
Murder. Same as you.

526
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,941
Innocent?

527
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,029
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

528
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,882
Where's the canary?

529
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,383
How did you know?

530
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,886
- How did I know what?
- So you don't know.

531
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,220
Come.

532
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,850
This is where the canary is.

533
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,856
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?

534
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,736
That's quite a...

535
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,363
surprise.

536
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,077
Wait, wait.

537
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,079
Here she comes.

538
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,249
I like this part when she
does that shit with her hair.

539
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,169
I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

540
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,254
Gilda, are you decent?

541
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,423
Me?

542
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,886
God, I love it.

543
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,061
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

544
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,774
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

545
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,109
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

546
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,070
Can you get her?

547
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,824
So this is Johnny Farrel.
I've heard a lot about you.

548
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,370
- Take a few weeks.
- Weeks?

549
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,958
I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

550
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,876
But I'll get her.

551
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,419
Relax.

552
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,589
Thanks.

553
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,945
- Take a walk!
- I got to change reels!

554
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,155
I said fuck off!

555
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,663
Ain't you going to scream?

556
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,874
Let's get this over with.

557
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,007
He broke my fucking nose!

558
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,517
Now...

559
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,186
I'm going to open my fly...

560
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,189
and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

561
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,943
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

562
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,279
He ought to have
something to show for it.

563
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,364
You put it in my mouth,
you lose it.

564
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,159
No, you don't understand.

565
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,537
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this in your ear.

566
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:48,207
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

567
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,335
causes the victim to bite down hard.

568
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,047
In fact, I hear the bite reflex
is so strong...

569
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,300
they have to pry
the victim's jaws open...

570
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,885
with a crowbar.

571
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,389
Where do you get this shit?

572
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:04,974
I read it.

573
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:09,062
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

574
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,023
Honey.

575
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,485
You shouldn't!

576
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,074
Bogs didn't put anything
in Andy's mouth.

577
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,409
And neither did his friends.

578
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,664
What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.

579
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,833
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

580
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,170
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

581
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,759
Time's up, Bogs.

582
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,264
It's your world, boss.

583
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,312
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

584
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,190
All prisoners report for lockdown.

585
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,123
What?

586
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,304
- Where's he going?
- Grab his ankles.

587
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:32,395
No! No! Help me!

588
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,651
Two things never happened again
after that.

589
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,071
The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.

590
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,408
And Bogs never walked again.

591
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,079
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

592
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,790
To my knowledge,
he lived out the rest of his days...

593
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,084
drinking his food through a straw.

594
00:45:56,086 --> 00:46:00,173
Andy could use a nice "welcome back"
when he gets out of the infirmary.

595
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,509
Sounds good to us.

596
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,262
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

597
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,265
The man likes to play chess.

598
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,684
Let's get him some rocks.

599
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,551
Guys!

600
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,386
I got one.

601
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,055
I got one. Look!

602
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:55,061
Heywood, that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

603
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,146
What are you, a fucking geologist?

604
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,065
He's right. It ain't.

605
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,193
- What the hell is it then?
- It's a horse apple.

606
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,571
- Bullshit!
- No, horseshit.

607
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,240
Petrified.

608
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,747
Oh, Jesus.

609
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,416
Damn!

610
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,963
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

611
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,173
And by the weekend
he was due back...

612
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:28,094
we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

613
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,430
Also got a big shipment in that week.

614
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,058
Cigarettes... chewing gum...

615
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,726
sipping whisky...

616
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,313
playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

617
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,275
And, of course, the most important item:

618
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,195
Rita Hayworth herself.

619
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,107
- Okay, look alive!
- Open all tiers.

620
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,568
Heads up. They're tossing cells.

621
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,487
Heads up. They're tossing cells!

622
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,574
119.

623
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,077
123.

624
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,339
On your feet.

625
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,509
Face the wall.

626
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,545
Turn around and face the warden.

627
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,221
Pleased to see you reading this.

628
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,474
Any favorite passages?

629
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,727
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

630
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,146
when the master
of the house cometh."

631
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,441
Mark 13:35.

632
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,069
I've always liked that one.

633
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,655
But I prefer:

634
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,991
"I am the light of the world.

635
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,744
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

636
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,580
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

637
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,916
I hear you're good with numbers.

638
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,084
How nice.

639
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,254
Man should have a skill.

640
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:11,841
Explain this.

641
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,096
It's called a rock blanket.
For shaping and polishing rocks.

642
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,432
A little hobby of mine.

643
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,736
It's pretty clean.

644
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,114
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

645
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,454
I can't say I approve of this.

646
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,540
But I suppose...

647
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,627
exceptions can be made.

648
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,306
Lock them up!

649
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,810
I almost forgot.

650
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,396
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

651
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,066
Salvation lies within.

652
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,317
Yes, sir.

653
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,453
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

654
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,832
Truth is... Norton
wanted to size Andy up.

655
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,848
My wife made that in church group.

656
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,811
Very nice, sir.

657
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,855
You enjoy working the laundry?

658
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,192
No, sir. Not especially.

659
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,986
Perhaps we can find something more...

660
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,697
befitting a man of your education.

661
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,249
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

662
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,878
I thought I heard you out here.

663
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,089
I've been reassigned to you.

664
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,716
I know, they told me.

665
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,594
Ain't that a kick in the head?

666
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,097
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

667
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,473
Come on.

668
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,601
Well, here she is.

669
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,812
The Shawshank Prison Library.

670
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,481
National Geographics...

671
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,193
Reader's Digest condensed books...

672
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,987
and Louis L'Amour.

673
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,406
Look magazine.

674
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,075
Erle Stanley Gardners.

675
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,787
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

676
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,665
I enter the names
on this clipboard here.

677
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,918
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

678
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,547
- Any questions?
- How long have you been librarian?

679
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:01,760
I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

680
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,264
And have you ever had an assistant?

681
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,933
No. Not much to it, really.

682
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,935
Why me? Why now?

683
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,645
I don't know.

684
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,899
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

685
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,454
That's him. That's the one.

686
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,254
I'm Dekins.

687
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,298
I was...

688
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:43,802
thinking about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

689
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,183
I see.

690
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,274
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

691
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,447
Do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

692
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,085
Thanks.

693
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,836
So...

694
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,340
Mr. Dekins...

695
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,260
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins..."

696
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,471
do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

697
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,722
He didn't say that!

698
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,558
As God as my witness!

699
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,560
Dekins blinked for a second...

700
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,897
then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

701
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,692
- My ass!
- Shook his hand.

702
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,736
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

703
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:47,199
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

704
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,035
he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

705
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,870
Making a few friends?

706
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,832
I wouldn't say "friends."

707
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:58,877
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

708
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,380
It's a wonderful pet to have.

709
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,382
Got you out of the laundry, though.

710
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,843
It might do more than that.

711
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,762
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

712
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,557
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

713
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,270
How do you expect to do that? I mean...

714
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,440
get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

715
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,984
I'll ask the warden for funds.

716
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:27,114
Six wardens have been through here
in my tenure, and I've learned...

717
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,742
one immutable, universal truth:

718
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,202
Not one of them born whose asshole...

719
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:36,415
wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

720
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,210
- The budget's stretched thin as it is.
- I see.

721
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,839
Perhaps I could write the state senate
and request funds from them.

722
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:48,135
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

723
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,763
More walls, more bars, more guards.

724
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,640
I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

725
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,602
- They can't ignore me forever.
- Sure can.

726
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,521
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

727
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,441
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

728
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,904
So Andy started writing
a letter a week...

729
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,697
just like he said.

730
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,496
And, just like Norton said...

731
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,164
Andy got no answers.

732
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:30,302
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

733
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,889
Year after that, he did them all...

734
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,058
including the warden's.

735
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,271
Year after that,
they rescheduled the intramural season...

736
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,899
to coincide with tax season.

737
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:49,947
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

738
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,490
So Moresby Prison...

739
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,951
issued you a gun,
but you paid for it.

740
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,869
Right. The holster too.

741
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,539
That's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

742
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,792
Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

743
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:07,005
In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.

744
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,716
Could you hand me
a stack of 1040s?

745
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:14,763
Got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year, and that was fine by me.

746
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:19,184
And still, he kept sending those letters.

747
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:26,984
It's Brooks.

748
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,611
Watch the door.

749
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,196
Please, Brooks.

750
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,240
- Calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

751
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,326
- Stay back, goddamn it!
- What's going on?

752
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,079
One second he's fine,
then out come the knife.

753
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,081
We can talk about this, right?

754
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:45,085
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

755
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,087
What's he done to you?

756
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,964
It's what they done!

757
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,716
I got no choice.

758
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,510
You won't hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

759
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,180
- Right, Heywood?
- Sure. I know that.

760
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,725
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

761
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,101
Right, guys?

762
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,563
So put the knife down.
Brooks, look at me.

763
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,065
Put the knife down.

764
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,069
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

765
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,156
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

766
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,533
It's the only...

767
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,785
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

768
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,413
This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

769
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,749
Put it... Put it down.

770
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,009
Take it easy.

771
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,261
You'll be all right.

772
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,889
Him? What about me?

773
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,475
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

774
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,602
You've had worse from shaving.

775
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,896
What did you do to set him off?

776
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,315
Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.

777
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,610
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

778
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,740
I just don't understand
what happened in there, that's all.

779
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,743
Old man's crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse.

780
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,828
That's enough out of you.

781
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,790
- Heard he had you shitting your pants.
- Fuck you.

782
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,250
Knock it off.

783
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,627
Brooks ain't no bug.

784
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,258
He's just institutionalized.

785
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,553
"Institutionalized," my ass.

786
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:21,765
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

787
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,684
This is all he knows.

788
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,186
In here, he's an important man...

789
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,479
an educated man.

790
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,232
Outside, he's nothing.

791
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:34,611
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

792
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,823
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

793
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,825
You know what I'm trying to say?

794
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,995
I do believe
you're talking out of your ass.

795
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,498
You believe whatever you want.

796
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,501
But I tell you these walls are funny.

797
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,754
First you hate them.

798
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,508
Then you get used to them.

799
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,429
Enough time passes...

800
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,098
you get so you depend on them.

801
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,310
That's "institutionalized."

802
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,811
Shit.

803
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,772
- I could never get like that.
- Oh, yeah?

804
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:14,151
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

805
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,944
Goddamn right.

806
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,449
They send you here for life...

807
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,452
that's exactly what they take.

808
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:27,205
Part that counts, anyway.

809
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,716
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

810
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,552
You go on now.

811
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:46,141
You're free.

812
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,828
Good luck, Brooksie.

813
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,208
Take care of yourself, Brooks.

814
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,284
Dear fellas:

815
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:50,789
I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.

816
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,751
Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?

817
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,464
I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...

818
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,551
but now they're everywhere.

819
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:10,517
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

820
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:30,120
The parole board
got me into this halfway house...

821
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,457
called "The Brewer"...
and a job...

822
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,626
bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

823
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,589
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

824
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,175
but my hands hurt most of the time.

825
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,427
Make sure your man double-bags.

826
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,679
Last time, the bottom near came out.

827
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,266
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

828
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,851
Yes, sir. Surely will.

829
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,563
I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.

830
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:03,862
Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

831
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,822
I keep thinking...

832
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,367
Jake might just show up
and say hello.

833
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:11,995
But he never does.

834
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:18,043
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.

835
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:24,382
I have trouble sleeping at night.

836
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:27,969
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

837
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,472
I wake up scared.

838
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:34,893
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

839
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:41,316
Maybe I should get me a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

840
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:45,946
I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

841
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:51,618
I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.

842
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,578
I don't like it here.

843
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:57,791
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...

844
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,293
not to stay.

845
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,765
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

846
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,477
not for an old crook like me.

847
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:24,210
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me."

848
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:29,090
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

849
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,635
"No hard feelings. Brooks."

850
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,064
He should have died in here.

851
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,029
What the fuck have you done?

852
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,865
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

853
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:03,166
- What's all this?
- You tell me. They're addressed to you.

854
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:05,752
Take it.

855
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,804
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:"

856
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,890
In response to your repeated inquiries...

857
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:23,395
"...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

858
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,981
This is $200.

859
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:30,193
"In addition, the library district
has generously responded..."

860
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,946
with a donation of used books
and sundries.

861
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:37,283
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

862
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,369
"Please stop sending us letters."

863
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:42,205
Clear all this out
before the warden gets back.

864
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,581
Yes, sir.

865
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,045
Good for you, Andy.

866
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,261
It only took six years.

867
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,598
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

868
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,102
I believe you're crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

869
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,813
like he said.
I've got to pinch a loaf.

870
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,481
When I come back...

871
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,442
this is all gone, all right?

872
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,617
Do you hear that?

873
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,520
Dufresne!

874
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:14,566
Andy, let me out!

875
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:26,411
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

876
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,913
Truth is, I don't want to know.

877
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,624
Some things are best left unsaid.

878
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,922
I like to think it was something
so beautiful...

879
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,258
it can't be expressed in words...

880
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:43,386
and makes your heart ache
because of it.

881
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:47,557
I tell you, those voices soared...

882
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:52,103
higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.

883
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:55,690
It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...

884
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,651
and made those walls dissolve away.

885
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,279
And for the briefest of moments...

886
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:04,490
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

887
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:09,746
It pissed the warden off
something awful.

888
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,040
Open the door.

889
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,711
Open it up!

890
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,757
Dufresne, open this door!

891
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:23,301
Turn that off!

892
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:32,810
I am warning you. Turn that off!

893
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:52,080
You're mine now.

894
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,757
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

895
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,550
On your feet.

896
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:08,137
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

897
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:13,559
You couldn't play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

898
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:16,688
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

899
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:20,024
- Was it worth two weeks?
- Easiest time I ever did.

900
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:24,445
- No such thing as easy time in the hole.
- A week in the hole is like a year.

901
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:27,949
- Damn straight.
- I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

902
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:31,119
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

903
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,914
It was in here.

904
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,000
In here.

905
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,211
That's the beauty of music. They...

906
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,755
can't get that from you.

907
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,678
Haven't you ever felt
that way about music?

908
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:53,599
Well, I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

909
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,352
Lost interest in it, though.

910
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,146
Didn't make much sense in here.

911
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,481
Here's where it makes the most sense.

912
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,067
You need it so you don't forget.

913
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,944
Forget?

914
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:09,949
Forget that there are...
places...

915
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:14,287
in the world
that aren't made out of stone.

916
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,789
There's something...

917
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:18,541
inside...

918
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,752
that they can't get to...

919
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:22,378
that they can't touch.

920
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,297
That's yours.

921
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,425
What are you talking about?

922
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:32,096
Hope.

923
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,059
Let me tell you something, my friend.

924
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,145
Hope is a dangerous thing.

925
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,648
Hope can drive a man insane.

926
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,526
It's got no use on the inside.

927
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,945
You'd better get used to that idea.

928
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,949
Like Brooks did?

929
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:18,309
Sit down.

930
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,943
Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

931
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,154
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

932
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:31,614
Oh, yes, sir.

933
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:34,200
Without a doubt.

934
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,787
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

935
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,707
No danger to society here.

936
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,793
God's honest truth.

937
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:48,464
Absolutely rehabilitated.

938
01:13:58,434 --> 01:13:59,767
Thirty years.

939
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:03,646
Jesus, when you say it like that...

940
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,315
You wonder where it went.

941
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:10,903
I wonder where 10 years went.

942
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:16,909
Here.

943
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:20,079
A little parole rejection present.

944
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:23,040
Go ahead and open it.

945
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,210
Went through one of your competitors.

946
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:29,547
I hope you don't mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

947
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,058
It's very pretty.

948
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:43,978
Thank you.

949
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,024
You going to play it?

950
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:53,863
No.

951
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:58,868
Not right now.

952
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:17,637
Roll in!

953
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,091
Lights out!

954
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,836
Andy was as good as his word.

955
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,964
He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.

956
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:41,137
In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...

957
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:44,515
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

958
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:49,020
Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...

959
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,105
just to shut him up.

960
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:54,317
And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

961
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:57,445
He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.

962
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:00,406
He bought remaindered books
by the pound...

963
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:02,450
Treasure Island.

964
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:05,536
Robert Louis... Stevenson.

965
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,163
Fiction, adventure.

966
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:10,750
What's next?

967
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:14,003
I got here Auto Repair...

968
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:15,880
and Soap Carving.

969
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:19,342
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under "Educational," behind you.

970
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:21,385
Count of Monte Crisco.

971
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:24,180
That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.

972
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:26,265
By Alexandree...

973
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,017
Dum-ass.

974
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:29,393
Dumb-ass.

975
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:32,730
Dumb-ass?

976
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,610
Dumas. Know what that's about?

977
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,906
You'd like it. It's about a prison break.

978
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:45,951
We ought to file that
under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

979
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:50,915
The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.

980
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,250
By the year Kennedy was shot...

981
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:58,005
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...

982
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:01,425
into the best prison library
in New England...

983
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:05,054
complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.

984
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:14,355
That was also when Warden Norton...

985
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:17,483
instituted his famous
"Inside Out" program.

986
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,027
You may remember reading about it.

987
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:23,364
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

988
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:24,907
It's no free ride...

989
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:28,285
but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

990
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,996
in corrections and rehabilitation.

991
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:33,874
Our inmates, properly supervised...

992
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:36,711
will be put to work
outside these walls...

993
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,005
performing all manner
of public service.

994
01:18:40,173 --> 01:18:42,967
These men can learn the value
of an honest day's labor...

995
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:46,971
while providing a valuable service
to the community...

996
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:51,892
and at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

997
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,645
Of course he didn't tell the press...

998
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:58,315
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

999
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:01,569
There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.

1000
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:04,280
Men, materials, you name it.

1001
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:07,491
And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!

1002
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,244
At this rate,
you'll put me out of business.

1003
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:14,874
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1004
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,419
We're providing
a valuable community service.

1005
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:22,298
That's fine for the papers,
but I've got a family to feed.

1006
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:26,510
We go back a long way.

1007
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:32,725
I need this highway contract. I don't
get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1008
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:35,436
You have some of this fine pie...

1009
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:39,023
my missus made for you.
You think about that.

1010
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:49,992
I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1011
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,287
It seems to me I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1012
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:58,334
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1013
01:19:59,419 --> 01:20:01,587
And behind every shady deal...

1014
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:04,548
behind every dollar earned...

1015
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:07,885
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1016
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,553
Two deposits.

1017
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:13,933
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1018
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:48,467
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1019
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:52,471
If they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear from me.

1020
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,014
How do I look?

1021
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:57,560
- Very nice.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1022
01:20:57,769 --> 01:20:59,270
Governor will be there.

1023
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,147
You want the rest of this?

1024
01:21:03,483 --> 01:21:05,442
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1025
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:07,987
Thank you, sir.

1026
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:14,076
He's got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1027
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:19,123
He's got scams you haven't even
dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1028
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,667
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1029
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:25,713
Sooner or later, he'll have to
explain where it came from.

1030
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:27,673
That's where I come in.

1031
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,593
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1032
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:33,637
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1033
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:37,474
I send it out into the real world,
and when it comes back...

1034
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:40,644
- Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?
- Cleaner.

1035
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:44,857
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1036
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:51,530
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1037
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:54,491
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1038
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,745
I know you're good,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1039
01:21:58,121 --> 01:21:59,955
Now anybody gets curious...

1040
01:22:00,123 --> 01:22:02,541
FBI, IRS, whatever.

1041
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,293
It'll lead to somebody.

1042
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:08,339
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1043
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:13,719
All right, who?

1044
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,512
Randall Stevens.

1045
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,014
Who?

1046
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,183
The "silent" silent partner.

1047
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:22,478
He's the guilty one,
the man with the bank accounts.

1048
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:24,855
It's where the filtering
process starts.

1049
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:27,900
They trace anything,
it'll just lead to him.

1050
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:29,735
But who is he?

1051
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:33,906
He's a phantom, an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1052
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:37,743
I conjured him...
out of thin air.

1053
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:41,288
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1054
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,710
You can't just make a person up.

1055
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,047
Sure you can,
if you know how the system works.

1056
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:53,384
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1057
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:56,345
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1058
01:22:56,554 --> 01:22:58,681
driver's license, Social Security.

1059
01:22:58,932 --> 01:22:59,932
You're shitting me.

1060
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,519
If they trace any accounts,
they'll wind up chasing...

1061
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:05,437
a figment of my imagination.

1062
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,648
Well, I'll be damned!

1063
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,734
Did I say you were good?

1064
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,736
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1065
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:15,197
The funny thing is...

1066
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:19,493
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1067
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:22,246
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1068
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,423
Ever bother you?

1069
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:36,927
I don't run the scams.
I just process the profits.

1070
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,179
A fine line, maybe...

1071
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,807
but I also built that library...

1072
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,060
and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1073
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,479
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

1074
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,898
Keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1075
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:51,567
Money instead of sheets.

1076
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:54,528
Well, I work cheap.
That's the tradeoff.

1077
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:14,423
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965...

1078
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,884
on a two-year stretch for B and E.

1079
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:19,470
That's breaking and entering to you.

1080
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:23,974
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1081
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:25,684
Young punk.

1082
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:29,271
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...
cocky as hell.

1083
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,857
Come on, old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1084
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:33,859
Making me look bad.

1085
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,861
We liked him immediately.

1086
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:39,823
I'm backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

1087
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,786
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

1088
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:46,371
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

1089
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:51,043
I was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1090
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:55,047
"You hear what I said, boy?"
I say, "Yes, sir. I did.

1091
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,717
But if I drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too."

1092
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:05,516
You done some stretch
in Cashman, right?

1093
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:09,978
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1094
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:12,189
Weekend furloughs. Work programs.

1095
01:25:12,857 --> 01:25:14,149
Not like here.

1096
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:16,068
Sounds like you done time all over.

1097
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,904
I've been in and out since I was 13.

1098
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,323
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1099
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:24,201
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1100
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,204
What I mean is...

1101
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,499
you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1102
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:34,419
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1103
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:36,421
What are you in for?

1104
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:37,714
Me?

1105
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,802
A lawyer fucked me.

1106
01:25:45,723 --> 01:25:48,684
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1107
01:25:56,568 --> 01:26:00,988
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1108
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,699
Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...

1109
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:06,410
or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

1110
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,078
Whatever it was...

1111
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,831
something lit a fire
under that boy's ass.

1112
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:17,546
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1113
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:20,257
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1114
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,844
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1115
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,764
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1116
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:31,310
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1117
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:34,438
You really mean that?

1118
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,815
Yes, sir, I do.

1119
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,984
Good. Because if we do this...

1120
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:43,155
we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1121
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:45,199
Thing is, see...

1122
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:47,993
I don't read so good.

1123
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:50,287
"Well."

1124
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,999
You don't read...

1125
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,792
so well.

1126
01:26:58,129 --> 01:26:59,630
We'll get to that.

1127
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,178
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1128
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:09,014
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1129
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:13,352
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1130
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:16,396
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1131
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:22,152
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1132
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:24,029
He really liked the kid.

1133
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,824
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1134
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,577
But that wasn't the only reason.

1135
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:33,497
Prison time is slow time.

1136
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:36,541
So you do what you can to keep going.

1137
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:38,961
Some fellas collect stamps.

1138
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:41,838
Others build matchstick houses.

1139
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:45,092
Andy built a library.

1140
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:47,511
Now he needed a new project.

1141
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:49,888
Tommy was it.

1142
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:54,518
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1143
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:58,313
The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1144
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:00,482
In prison...

1145
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:04,486
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1146
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:10,117
By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...

1147
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:12,536
it was lovely Raquel.

1148
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:30,095
Time.

1149
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:37,394
Well?

1150
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,897
Well, it's for shit.

1151
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:44,234
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1152
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:45,902
It's probably not that bad.

1153
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:50,365
I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1154
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:52,284
Let's see how the score comes out.

1155
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:55,454
I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1156
01:28:57,415 --> 01:28:58,749
Two points, right there!

1157
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:00,542
There's your goddamn score!

1158
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:04,463
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25...

1159
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:07,049
Fuck this place!

1160
01:29:07,258 --> 01:29:08,425
Fuck it!

1161
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:28,820
I feel bad.

1162
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,238
I let him down.

1163
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:32,157
That's crap, kid.

1164
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:33,700
He's proud of you.

1165
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,912
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1166
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:38,663
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1167
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:42,000
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1168
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,461
What's he in here for anyway?

1169
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:45,754
Murder.

1170
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:48,590
The hell, you say.

1171
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:53,053
You wouldn't think it
to look at the guy.

1172
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:58,392
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1173
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:07,776
What?

1174
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:11,321
About four years ago...

1175
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:14,825
I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1176
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:16,618
I stole a car.

1177
01:30:16,994 --> 01:30:18,995
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1178
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,873
About six months left to go...

1179
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:24,084
I get a new cellmate in.

1180
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:26,420
Elmo Blatch.

1181
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,463
Big, twitchy fucker.

1182
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,843
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1183
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,762
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1184
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:38,306
Said he pulled hundreds ofjobs.

1185
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:43,437
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1186
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:49,151
Talked all the time too.
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1187
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,986
Places he'd been in...

1188
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,364
jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1189
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,783
Even people he killed.

1190
01:30:58,035 --> 01:31:00,829
People who "gave him shit."

1191
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,039
That's how he put it.

1192
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,711
So one night, like a joke...

1193
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:12,299
I say to him,
"Elmo, who did you kill?"

1194
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,675
So he says:

1195
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:17,804
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1196
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:22,392
so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1197
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,480
So I pick out this guy...

1198
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:30,901
go in one night...
and do his place.

1199
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,653
He wakes up...

1200
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:36,156
and gives me shit.

1201
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:38,909
So I killed him.

1202
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:43,497
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1203
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:47,167
And that's the best part.

1204
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:50,295
She's fucking this prick, see...

1205
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,590
this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1206
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,760
Some hotshot banker.

1207
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,680
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1208
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:16,029
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1209
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:19,783
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1210
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,535
Sir?

1211
01:32:23,746 --> 01:32:27,332
It's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1212
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:31,878
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1213
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:34,256
He's young, not terribly bright.

1214
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:38,218
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1215
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:40,178
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1216
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:45,141
Let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1217
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:50,021
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess."

1218
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:52,941
By the way,
add a life term to my sentence."

1219
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,944
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1220
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:58,613
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1221
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,782
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1222
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:05,579
They'd have his last known address, names
of relatives. It's a chance, isn't it?

1223
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,666
How can you be so obtuse?

1224
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:11,835
What?

1225
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:14,546
What did you call me?

1226
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,506
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1227
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:18,341
You're forgetting yourself.

1228
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:21,636
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1229
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,598
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1230
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:27,517
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1231
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:30,312
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1232
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:33,106
If I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1233
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:36,693
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1234
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:41,531
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1235
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,366
Not in this office...

1236
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,535
not anywhere. Get in here, now!

1237
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:48,455
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1238
01:33:49,081 --> 01:33:51,207
- Solitary. A month.
- Yes, sir.

1239
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:54,169
- What's the matter with you?
- Get him out of here.

1240
01:33:54,378 --> 01:33:57,922
This is my chance to get out!
It's my life! Don't you understand?!

1241
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:00,216
Get him out!

1242
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:03,928
A month in the hole.

1243
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:06,848
That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

1244
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:08,350
It's all my fault.

1245
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:10,143
Bullshit.

1246
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:13,521
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1247
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:16,107
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1248
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,360
I mean, for real innocent?

1249
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:19,903
It looks that way.

1250
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,238
Sweet Jesus.

1251
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,324
How long has he been here now?

1252
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,994
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.

1253
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:30,830
- Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1254
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:37,837
What you got?

1255
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:39,798
Board of Education.

1256
01:34:40,007 --> 01:34:41,549
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1257
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:45,720
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1258
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,098
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1259
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:51,434
Skeets, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1260
01:34:52,269 --> 01:34:53,603
Floyd, come on.

1261
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:01,444
Will you throw that away, please?

1262
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:08,785
Well, shit.

1263
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:24,259
The kid passed. C-plus average.

1264
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:26,553
Thought you'd like to know.

1265
01:35:42,778 --> 01:35:44,237
Warden wants to talk.

1266
01:35:58,002 --> 01:35:59,043
Out here?

1267
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:01,504
That's what the man said.

1268
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:18,855
Warden?

1269
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:32,702
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1270
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,456
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1271
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:56,976
We got a situation here.

1272
01:36:57,853 --> 01:36:59,938
I think you can appreciate that.

1273
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:01,397
Yes, sir.

1274
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,066
I sure can.

1275
01:37:03,317 --> 01:37:07,362
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1276
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,407
It's got me up nights. That's the truth.

1277
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:15,495
The right thing to do...

1278
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:20,917
sometimes it's hard to know
what that is.

1279
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:23,336
Do you understand?

1280
01:37:25,631 --> 01:37:27,257
I need your help, son.

1281
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:30,844
If I'm going to move on this...

1282
01:37:31,178 --> 01:37:34,347
there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1283
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:36,140
I have to know...

1284
01:37:36,308 --> 01:37:38,977
if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1285
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:40,311
Yes, sir.

1286
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:41,771
Absolutely.

1287
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:45,275
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1288
01:37:45,442 --> 01:37:47,443
with your hand on the Good Book...

1289
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:50,321
and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1290
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:52,323
Just give me that chance.

1291
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:57,954
That's what I thought.

1292
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:46,920
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1293
01:38:48,672 --> 01:38:49,714
Terrible thing.

1294
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:52,800
A man that young...

1295
01:38:53,135 --> 01:38:55,720
less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1296
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:58,765
Broke Captain Hadley's heart
to shoot him.

1297
01:38:59,516 --> 01:39:01,017
Truly, it did.

1298
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:06,439
We just have to put it behind us.

1299
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:09,359
Move on.

1300
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:12,445
I'm done.

1301
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:15,365
Everything stops.

1302
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:19,702
Get someone else to run your scams.

1303
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:22,789
Nothing stops.

1304
01:39:24,124 --> 01:39:25,500
Nothing.

1305
01:39:28,712 --> 01:39:31,798
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1306
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,550
No more protection from the guards.

1307
01:39:34,718 --> 01:39:39,639
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1308
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:43,476
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1309
01:39:44,895 --> 01:39:46,396
And the library?

1310
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:48,064
Gone.

1311
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:51,234
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1312
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:54,362
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1313
01:39:54,571 --> 01:39:56,698
They'll see the flames for miles.

1314
01:39:56,907 --> 01:39:59,742
We'll dance around it like wild lnjuns.

1315
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:03,997
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1316
01:40:07,751 --> 01:40:09,585
Or am I being obtuse?

1317
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:24,017
Give him another month
to think about it.

1318
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:13,816
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1319
01:41:14,651 --> 01:41:16,486
Like a closed book.

1320
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:19,322
Complained about it all the time.

1321
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,824
She was beautiful.

1322
01:41:24,203 --> 01:41:26,037
God, I loved her.

1323
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,667
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1324
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:36,089
I killed her, Red.

1325
01:41:37,966 --> 01:41:39,759
I didn't pull the trigger...

1326
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:42,929
but I drove her away.

1327
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:47,141
That's why she died, because of me...

1328
01:41:47,309 --> 01:41:48,684
the way I am.

1329
01:41:57,694 --> 01:41:59,529
That don't make you a murderer.

1330
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:04,700
Bad husband, maybe.

1331
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:11,582
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1332
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:13,126
No, I didn't.

1333
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,461
Somebody else did.

1334
01:42:16,713 --> 01:42:18,798
And I wound up in here.

1335
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,885
Bad luck, I guess.

1336
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:29,517
It floats around.

1337
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:32,770
It's got to land on somebody.

1338
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:35,565
It was my turn, that's all.

1339
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:39,068
I was in the path of the tornado.

1340
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,953
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1341
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:55,001
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1342
01:42:56,253 --> 01:42:57,670
Me?

1343
01:43:00,257 --> 01:43:01,591
Yeah.

1344
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:04,886
One day, when I got
a long, white beard...

1345
01:43:05,095 --> 01:43:09,182
and two or three marbles rolling
around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1346
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:11,934
I tell you where I'd go.

1347
01:43:13,395 --> 01:43:15,104
Zihuatanejo.

1348
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:17,106
Say what?

1349
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,275
Zihuatanejo.

1350
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:21,861
It's in Mexico.

1351
01:43:23,238 --> 01:43:25,364
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1352
01:43:26,491 --> 01:43:29,285
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1353
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:33,122
They say it has no memory.

1354
01:43:35,083 --> 01:43:37,752
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1355
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:41,881
A warm place with no memory.

1356
01:43:45,135 --> 01:43:47,053
Open up a little hotel...

1357
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,264
right on the beach.

1358
01:43:50,849 --> 01:43:53,059
Buy some worthless old boat...

1359
01:43:53,602 --> 01:43:55,228
and fix it up new.

1360
01:43:57,981 --> 01:43:59,190
Take my guests out...

1361
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:01,400
charter fishing.

1362
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:06,989
Zihuatanejo.

1363
01:44:10,494 --> 01:44:14,372
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1364
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:23,756
I don't think I could make it
on the outside.

1365
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:32,515
I been in here most of my life.

1366
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:35,685
I'm an institutional man now.

1367
01:44:36,603 --> 01:44:38,354
Just like Brooks was.

1368
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:41,524
You underestimate yourself.

1369
01:44:42,067 --> 01:44:43,693
I don't think so.

1370
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:51,450
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1371
01:44:52,202 --> 01:44:54,745
outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1372
01:44:54,955 --> 01:44:57,206
Hell, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1373
01:44:59,334 --> 01:45:00,960
Pacific Ocean?

1374
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:02,586
Shit.

1375
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:05,172
Scare me to death, something that big.

1376
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:06,674
Not me.

1377
01:45:07,884 --> 01:45:10,636
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1378
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:15,599
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1379
01:45:16,643 --> 01:45:18,144
That hotel, that boat...

1380
01:45:19,896 --> 01:45:22,148
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1381
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:29,488
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1382
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:31,741
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1383
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,618
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1384
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:36,412
and that's the way it is.

1385
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:39,582
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1386
01:45:41,084 --> 01:45:43,461
It's down there and I'm in here.

1387
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:48,758
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1388
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:53,179
Get busy living...

1389
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:56,599
or get busy dying.

1390
01:46:08,695 --> 01:46:11,447
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1391
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:13,908
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1392
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:19,622
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1393
01:46:21,124 --> 01:46:24,251
- A lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1394
01:46:24,461 --> 01:46:28,381
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1395
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:31,467
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1396
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,887
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1397
01:46:36,306 --> 01:46:38,391
We went there for a picnic...

1398
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:40,893
and made love under that oak...

1399
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:43,813
and I asked and she said yes.

1400
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:49,652
Promise me, Red.

1401
01:46:50,487 --> 01:46:53,823
If you ever get out...
find that spot.

1402
01:46:54,991 --> 01:46:59,829
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1403
01:47:00,956 --> 01:47:03,999
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1404
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:09,338
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1405
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:11,340
What, Andy?

1406
01:47:11,758 --> 01:47:13,509
What's buried under there?

1407
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:18,431
You'll have to pry it up...
to see.

1408
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:26,272
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1409
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,691
He's talking funny.

1410
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:31,485
I'm really worried about him.

1411
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:33,320
Let's keep an eye on him.

1412
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:36,782
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1413
01:47:38,201 --> 01:47:39,368
Oh, Lord.

1414
01:47:40,704 --> 01:47:42,288
What?

1415
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:45,791
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1416
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:48,085
He asked me for a length of rope.

1417
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:51,005
- Rope?
- Six feet long.

1418
01:47:51,214 --> 01:47:52,590
And you gave it to him.

1419
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:55,259
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

1420
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:57,052
Jesus! Heywood.

1421
01:47:57,637 --> 01:47:59,597
How was I supposed to know?

1422
01:47:59,806 --> 01:48:01,390
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1423
01:48:03,393 --> 01:48:05,311
Andy would never do that.

1424
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:07,354
Never.

1425
01:48:09,065 --> 01:48:10,399
I don't know.

1426
01:48:13,236 --> 01:48:15,237
Every man has his breaking point.

1427
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:19,867
Lickety-split. Want to get home.

1428
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,911
Just about finished, sir.

1429
01:48:39,054 --> 01:48:40,679
Three deposits tonight.

1430
01:48:48,647 --> 01:48:50,564
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1431
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:52,399
And shine my shoes.

1432
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:55,528
- I want them looking like mirrors.
- Yes, sir.

1433
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:02,493
It's good having you back.

1434
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:05,287
Place wasn't the same without you.

1435
01:49:52,168 --> 01:49:53,544
Lights out!

1436
01:50:26,077 --> 01:50:28,621
I've had some long nights in the stir.

1437
01:50:29,164 --> 01:50:31,832
Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...

1438
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,710
time can draw out like a blade.

1439
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:43,052
That was the longest night of my life.

1440
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:00,069
Give me a count!

1441
01:51:04,574 --> 01:51:07,409
Tier 3 south, clear!

1442
01:51:10,538 --> 01:51:13,707
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1443
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:14,958
Dufresne!

1444
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:17,920
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1445
01:51:21,091 --> 01:51:24,468
Don't make me come down
or I'll thump your skull for you!

1446
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:35,896
Damn it, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1447
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:39,400
You'd better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

1448
01:51:39,609 --> 01:51:40,943
You hear me?

1449
01:51:47,033 --> 01:51:49,118
Oh, my Holy God.

1450
01:52:06,136 --> 01:52:08,679
I want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

1451
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:11,682
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1452
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:13,267
Him.

1453
01:52:14,269 --> 01:52:15,811
Open 237.

1454
01:52:19,315 --> 01:52:22,985
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?
Don't say that to me.

1455
01:52:23,862 --> 01:52:26,447
- Don't say that to me again.
- But, sir, he wasn't.

1456
01:52:26,656 --> 01:52:30,159
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?

1457
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:32,411
Is that what you're saying?

1458
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:35,080
- Am I blind, Haig?
- No, sir!

1459
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:38,500
What about you. You blind?

1460
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:41,545
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1461
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,048
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. Right there.

1462
01:52:45,258 --> 01:52:46,592
"Dufresne."

1463
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:51,013
He was in his cell at lights out.

1464
01:52:51,181 --> 01:52:54,099
Stands to reason he'd still be here
in the morning.

1465
01:52:54,434 --> 01:52:56,059
I want him found.

1466
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:59,730
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1467
01:52:59,981 --> 01:53:01,190
Yes, sir.

1468
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:05,986
Let's go. Move your butts. Move it!

1469
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:08,864
Stand.

1470
01:53:10,283 --> 01:53:11,700
Well?

1471
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:15,829
Well, what?

1472
01:53:15,997 --> 01:53:19,458
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1473
01:53:20,543 --> 01:53:22,044
He must have said something.

1474
01:53:22,754 --> 01:53:25,672
No, sir, warden. Not a word.

1475
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:30,052
Lord, it's a miracle!

1476
01:53:30,637 --> 01:53:33,222
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1477
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:35,057
Nothing left...

1478
01:53:35,892 --> 01:53:38,602
but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

1479
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:41,563
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let's ask her.

1480
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:43,524
Maybe she knows.

1481
01:53:43,733 --> 01:53:46,485
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1482
01:53:47,904 --> 01:53:49,238
Guess not.

1483
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:51,990
Why should she be any different?

1484
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:54,743
This is a conspiracy.

1485
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:57,079
That's what this is.

1486
01:53:57,789 --> 01:54:01,542
One big, damn conspiracy!

1487
01:54:01,793 --> 01:54:03,794
And everyone's in on it!

1488
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:05,587
Including her!

1489
01:54:40,623 --> 01:54:44,960
In 1966... Andy
Dufresne escaped...

1490
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:46,712
from Shawshank Prison.

1491
01:54:48,965 --> 01:54:51,508
All they found
was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1492
01:54:52,135 --> 01:54:55,470
a bar of soap... and
an old rock hammer...

1493
01:54:55,638 --> 01:54:58,140
damn near worn down to the nub.

1494
01:55:02,645 --> 01:55:07,399
I remember thinking it would take a man 600
years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1495
01:55:08,026 --> 01:55:10,652
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1496
01:55:28,963 --> 01:55:31,256
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1497
01:55:32,008 --> 01:55:35,177
I imagine it appealed to
his meticulous nature.

1498
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:37,429
An ice age here...

1499
01:55:37,847 --> 01:55:40,349
million years
of mountain-building there.

1500
01:55:41,351 --> 01:55:44,186
Geology is the study
of pressure and time.

1501
01:55:45,021 --> 01:55:47,022
That's all it takes, really.

1502
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:49,066
Pressure...

1503
01:55:49,525 --> 01:55:51,026
and time.

1504
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:54,196
That and a big goddamn poster.

1505
01:55:57,992 --> 01:55:59,159
Like I said...

1506
01:55:59,661 --> 01:56:03,664
in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1507
01:56:06,459 --> 01:56:11,254
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...

1508
01:56:11,798 --> 01:56:13,715
a handful at a time.

1509
01:56:15,051 --> 01:56:17,094
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1510
01:56:17,303 --> 01:56:20,263
Andy decided
he'd been here long enough.

1511
01:56:20,473 --> 01:56:23,058
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1512
01:56:23,768 --> 01:56:25,811
I'm just about finished, sir.

1513
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:49,209
Three deposits tonight.

1514
01:56:56,509 --> 01:56:58,802
Andy did like he was told.

1515
01:56:59,012 --> 01:57:02,514
Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.

1516
01:57:06,185 --> 01:57:08,478
The guards simply didn't notice.

1517
01:57:08,771 --> 01:57:10,272
Neither did I.

1518
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:11,982
I mean, seriously...

1519
01:57:12,191 --> 01:57:15,193
how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?

1520
01:59:18,734 --> 01:59:21,903
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...

1521
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:25,490
of shit-smelling foulness
I can't even imagine.

1522
01:59:26,492 --> 01:59:28,827
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1523
01:59:33,249 --> 01:59:35,584
Five hundred yards.

1524
01:59:36,085 --> 01:59:39,171
That's the length
of five football fields.

1525
01:59:39,797 --> 01:59:42,382
Just shy of half a mile.

1526
02:00:37,605 --> 02:00:42,192
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her secret...

1527
02:00:42,485 --> 02:00:45,320
a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...

1528
02:00:45,571 --> 02:00:48,156
strolled into
the Maine National Bank.

1529
02:00:48,741 --> 02:00:51,910
Until that moment, he didn't exist.

1530
02:00:52,495 --> 02:00:54,829
- Except on paper.
- May I help you?

1531
02:00:55,248 --> 02:00:57,165
He had all the proper ID...

1532
02:00:57,375 --> 02:01:01,086
Driver's license, birth certificate,
Social Security card.

1533
02:01:01,504 --> 02:01:04,047
And the signature
was a spot-on match.

1534
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:07,342
I must say I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1535
02:01:07,551 --> 02:01:09,302
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1536
02:01:10,096 --> 02:01:11,680
Thank you.

1537
02:01:11,847 --> 02:01:13,014
I'm sure I will.

1538
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:17,269
Here's your cashier's check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1539
02:01:17,478 --> 02:01:18,478
Please.

1540
02:01:19,021 --> 02:01:21,523
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1541
02:01:22,024 --> 02:01:23,566
I'd be happy to.

1542
02:01:25,027 --> 02:01:26,361
Good day, sir.

1543
02:01:27,321 --> 02:01:31,741
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1544
02:01:32,201 --> 02:01:33,827
All told, he blew town...

1545
02:01:34,036 --> 02:01:38,873
with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1546
02:01:39,542 --> 02:01:42,335
Severance pay for 19 years.

1547
02:01:49,552 --> 02:01:51,761
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1548
02:02:44,607 --> 02:02:47,567
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1549
02:02:47,818 --> 02:02:52,280
If you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1550
02:02:52,698 --> 02:02:57,160
I wasn't there to see it, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1551
02:02:57,370 --> 02:02:58,870
when they took him away.

1552
02:03:04,752 --> 02:03:08,129
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

1553
02:03:24,105 --> 02:03:25,480
Samuel Norton.

1554
02:03:25,648 --> 02:03:28,066
We have a warrant for your arrest.
Open up.

1555
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:34,280
Open the door.

1556
02:03:34,448 --> 02:03:35,698
I'm not sure which key.

1557
02:03:45,835 --> 02:03:47,794
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1558
02:03:59,306 --> 02:04:02,767
I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...

1559
02:04:02,977 --> 02:04:04,561
other than that bullet...

1560
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:09,190
was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1561
02:04:11,694 --> 02:04:15,196
Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...

1562
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:17,532
I got a postcard in the mail.

1563
02:04:18,993 --> 02:04:21,828
It was blank, but the postmark said...

1564
02:04:22,037 --> 02:04:24,164
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1565
02:04:24,707 --> 02:04:26,040
Fort Hancock...

1566
02:04:26,333 --> 02:04:28,042
right on the border.

1567
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:30,462
That's where Andy crossed.

1568
02:04:31,046 --> 02:04:35,175
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...

1569
02:04:35,509 --> 02:04:37,719
it always makes me laugh.

1570
02:04:39,555 --> 02:04:41,139
Andy Dufresne...

1571
02:04:41,515 --> 02:04:43,558
who crawled through
a river of shit...

1572
02:04:43,726 --> 02:04:46,144
and came out clean
on the other side.

1573
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:48,354
Andy Dufresne...

1574
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:50,732
headed for the Pacific.

1575
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:55,904
Hadley's got him
by the throat, right?

1576
02:04:56,071 --> 02:04:59,908
He says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1577
02:05:00,075 --> 02:05:02,952
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1578
02:05:03,621 --> 02:05:05,330
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1579
02:05:05,539 --> 02:05:08,500
"My friends could use
a couple of beers."

1580
02:05:08,834 --> 02:05:10,502
And he got it!

1581
02:05:11,754 --> 02:05:14,130
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1582
02:05:14,423 --> 02:05:15,840
Andy being gone.

1583
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:20,678
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1584
02:05:21,138 --> 02:05:23,223
Their feathers are just too bright.

1585
02:05:24,934 --> 02:05:26,643
And when they fly away...

1586
02:05:27,102 --> 02:05:31,481
the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1587
02:05:32,566 --> 02:05:33,816
But still...

1588
02:05:34,276 --> 02:05:38,613
the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.

1589
02:05:42,826 --> 02:05:45,203
I guess I just miss my friend.

1590
02:06:09,645 --> 02:06:10,812
Please sit down.

1591
02:06:16,652 --> 02:06:18,236
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1592
02:06:18,779 --> 02:06:22,031
your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1593
02:06:22,825 --> 02:06:24,993
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1594
02:06:26,829 --> 02:06:28,413
Rehabilitated?

1595
02:06:30,457 --> 02:06:32,333
Well, now, let me see.

1596
02:06:33,335 --> 02:06:35,670
I don't have any idea what that means.

1597
02:06:37,798 --> 02:06:40,049
It means you're ready
to rejoin society...

1598
02:06:40,634 --> 02:06:42,969
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1599
02:06:45,139 --> 02:06:47,140
To me it's just a made-up word.

1600
02:06:48,475 --> 02:06:50,810
A politician's word so that...

1601
02:06:51,228 --> 02:06:54,772
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1602
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:56,858
and have a job.

1603
02:06:58,819 --> 02:07:00,903
What do you really want to know?

1604
02:07:01,697 --> 02:07:03,656
Am I sorry for what I did?

1605
02:07:04,074 --> 02:07:05,366
Well, are you?

1606
02:07:07,161 --> 02:07:09,996
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1607
02:07:11,373 --> 02:07:14,834
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1608
02:07:18,297 --> 02:07:20,882
I look back on the way I was then...

1609
02:07:23,010 --> 02:07:24,344
a young...

1610
02:07:25,262 --> 02:07:28,765
stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1611
02:07:31,769 --> 02:07:33,478
I want to talk to him.

1612
02:07:35,397 --> 02:07:37,899
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1613
02:07:38,609 --> 02:07:40,568
Tell him the way things are.

1614
02:07:42,655 --> 02:07:44,072
But I can't.

1615
02:07:46,283 --> 02:07:48,284
That kid's long gone...

1616
02:07:49,495 --> 02:07:52,246
and this old man is all that's left.

1617
02:07:53,666 --> 02:07:55,124
I got to live with that.

1618
02:07:56,502 --> 02:07:58,211
Rehabilitated?

1619
02:07:58,587 --> 02:08:00,421
It's just a bullshit word.

1620
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:06,094
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1621
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:09,597
Because to tell you the truth...

1622
02:08:09,932 --> 02:08:11,933
I don't give a shit.

1623
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:39,854
Here you go, miss.

1624
02:09:42,816 --> 02:09:43,858
Restroom break?

1625
02:09:49,656 --> 02:09:54,202
You don't need to ask me every time you
need to go take a piss. Just go.

1626
02:09:55,204 --> 02:09:56,829
Yes, sir.

1627
02:10:07,216 --> 02:10:10,301
Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.

1628
02:10:11,136 --> 02:10:14,138
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1629
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:19,811
There's a harsh truth to face.

1630
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:24,398
No way I'm going to make it
on the outside.

1631
02:10:32,241 --> 02:10:35,952
All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...

1632
02:10:36,745 --> 02:10:39,247
so maybe they'd send me back.

1633
02:10:44,419 --> 02:10:46,879
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1634
02:10:47,756 --> 02:10:49,423
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1635
02:10:49,633 --> 02:10:51,592
Knew it all too well.

1636
02:10:53,178 --> 02:10:56,597
All I want is to be back
where things make sense.

1637
02:10:57,015 --> 02:10:59,767
Where I won't have to be afraid
all the time.

1638
02:11:01,770 --> 02:11:04,105
Only one thing stops me.

1639
02:11:05,566 --> 02:11:07,942
A promise I made to Andy.

1640
02:11:28,463 --> 02:11:29,797
There it is.

1641
02:11:40,225 --> 02:11:41,893
Much obliged, sir.

1642
02:15:21,196 --> 02:15:22,488
Dear Red:

1643
02:15:22,697 --> 02:15:25,199
If you're reading this,
you've gotten out...

1644
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:29,537
and if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a bit further.

1645
02:15:29,704 --> 02:15:32,206
You remember the name
of the town, don't you?

1646
02:15:34,501 --> 02:15:36,001
Zihuatanejo.

1647
02:15:37,629 --> 02:15:41,215
I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

1648
02:15:41,716 --> 02:15:45,261
I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.

1649
02:15:46,054 --> 02:15:47,471
Remember, Red...

1650
02:15:47,806 --> 02:15:49,890
hope is a good thing...

1651
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:52,101
maybe the best of things.

1652
02:15:52,310 --> 02:15:54,478
And no good thing ever dies.

1653
02:15:55,021 --> 02:15:57,898
I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...

1654
02:15:58,066 --> 02:15:59,817
and finds you well.

1655
02:16:00,318 --> 02:16:02,903
Your friend... Andy.

1656
02:16:36,771 --> 02:16:40,608
"Get busy living...
or get busy dying."

1657
02:16:43,278 --> 02:16:45,446
That's goddamn right.

1658
02:16:50,702 --> 02:16:52,828
For the second time in my life...

1659
02:16:53,079 --> 02:16:55,623
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1660
02:16:56,708 --> 02:16:58,626
Parole violation.

1661
02:16:59,294 --> 02:17:02,963
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1662
02:17:03,632 --> 02:17:05,674
Not for an old crook like me.

1663
02:17:05,884 --> 02:17:07,927
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1664
02:17:11,598 --> 02:17:16,310
I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1665
02:17:16,770 --> 02:17:20,105
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1666
02:17:20,315 --> 02:17:22,816
A free man at the start
of a long journey...

1667
02:17:22,984 --> 02:17:25,611
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1668
02:17:28,615 --> 02:17:31,283
I hope I can make it across the border.

1669
02:17:32,786 --> 02:17:35,829
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

1670
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:41,752
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1671
02:17:43,588 --> 02:17:44,797
I hope.
