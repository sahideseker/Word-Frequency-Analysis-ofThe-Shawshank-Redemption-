1
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,501
Ms Dufresne, describe

2
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,047
the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,387
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:23,058
She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,063
And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,984
What was your response

7
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,984
I told her I would not grant one

8
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,984
I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno.

9
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,907
Those were your words, according to your neighbors.

10
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,577
If they say so.

11
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,621
I really don't remember

12
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,621
I was upset.

13
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,332
What happened after you argued with your wife

14
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,252
She packed a bag.

15
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,590
She packed a bag to go and stay with Ms Quentin.

16
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,344
Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club

17
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,681
whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.

18
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,185
Did you follow her

19
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,605
I went to a few bars first.

20
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:14,193
Later, I drove to his house to confront them

21
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:14,193
They weren't home.

22
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,278
I parked in the turnout

23
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,988
and waited.

24
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,865
With what intention

25
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,909
I'm not sure.

26
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,954
I was confused..

27
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,954
drunk.

28
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,959
I think..

29
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,959
mostly I wanted to scare them.

30
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,504
When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.

31
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,798
No, I was sobering up.

32
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,677
I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.

33
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,847
Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.

34
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,141
I've been very clear on this point.

35
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:50,354
I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning

36
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,148
and finds your wife in bed with her lover

37
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,484
riddled with .38 caliber bullets.

38
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,031
Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me

39
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,950
Yes, it does.

40
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,328
Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river

41
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,580
before the murders took place.

42
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,999
That's very convenient.

43
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,876
It's the truth.

44
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,839
The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found

45
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:22,135
so no comparison could be made between your gun and the bullets

46
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,764
taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

47
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,850
And that also

48
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,729
is very convenient

49
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,729
Isn't it, Ms Dufresne

50
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,149
Since I am innocent of this crime

51
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:41,029
I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.

52
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,217
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.

53
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,263
We have the accused at the scene of the crime

54
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,263
We have footprints.

55
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,349
Bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints.

56
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,519
A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.

57
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,271
And most of all

58
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,566
we have a beautiful young woman and her lover

59
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,776
lying dead in each other's arms.

60
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,572
They had sinned.

61
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,326
But was their crime so great

62
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,786
as to merit a death sentence

63
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,289
While you think about that..

64
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,289
think about this:

65
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,130
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

66
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,051
I submit that this was not a hot blooded crime of passion.

67
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,054
That at least could be understood, if not condoned.

68
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,263
No.

69
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,432
This was revenge..

70
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,432
of a much more brutal, cold blooded nature

71
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,432
Consider this:

72
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,855
Four bullets per victim.

73
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,316
Not six shots fired, but eight.

74
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,445
That means that he fired the gun empty

75
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,448
and then stopped to reload

76
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,284
so that he could shoot each of them again.

77
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,079
An extra bullet per lover

78
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,623
right in the head.

79
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:22,923
You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Ms Dufresne.

80
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,467
It chills my blood just to look at you.

81
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,138
By the power vested in me by the state of Maine

82
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:34,643
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back to back

83
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,521
one for each of your victims

84
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,521
So be it

85
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,839
Sit.

86
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,179
We see you've served 20 years of a life sentence

87
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,350
Yes, sir

88
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,350
You feel you've been rehabilitated

89
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,353
Yes, sir

90
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,353
Absolutely, sir.

91
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,481
I mean, I learned my lesson.

92
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,986
I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.

93
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,575
I'm no longer a danger to society.

94
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,743
That's God's honest truth.

95
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,364
Hey, Red.

96
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,866
How'd it go

97
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,243
Same old shit, different day.

98
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,370
Yeah, I know how you feel.

99
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,581
I'm up for rejection next week.

100
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,876
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

101
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,377
It happens.

102
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,004
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

103
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,508
Get out of my face, man

104
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,508
You're into me for five packs already.

105
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,717
Four

106
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,717
Five

107
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,263
There must be a con like me in every prison in America.

108
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,265
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

109
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,602
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer, if that's your thing

110
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,231
a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation.

111
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,566
Damn near anything within reason.

112
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,487
Yes, sir

113
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,487
I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

114
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,368
So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949

115
00:08:56,577 --> 00:09:00,121
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him..

116
00:08:56,577 --> 00:09:00,121
I told him, No problem.

117
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:26,314
Officers to main gate

118
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:26,314
Officers to main gate.

119
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,526
Secure main gate.

120
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,668
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

121
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,755
in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.

122
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,176
On the outside, he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank.

123
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,387
Good work for a man so young.

124
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,269
Hey, Red.

125
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,390
You speak English, butt steak

126
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,476
You follow this officer.

127
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:01,493
I never seen such a sorry looking heap of maggot shit in all my life.

128
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,329
Hey, fish

129
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,329
Come over here

130
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,978
Taking bets today, Red

131
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,064
Smokes or coin

132
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,064
Bettor's choice.

133
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,941
Smokes

134
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,941
Put me down for two.

135
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,068
All right, who's your horse

136
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,028
That little sack of shit.

137
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,908
Eighth

138
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,908
He'll be first

139
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,908
Bullshit

140
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,908
I'll take that action.

141
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,327
You're out some smokes, son.

142
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,287
If you're so smart, you call it.

143
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,582
I'll take the chubby fat ass there.

144
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,377
The fifth one

145
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,377
Put me down for a quarter deck.

146
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,298
Fresh fish today

147
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,509
We're reeling them in

148
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,847
I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him.

149
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,308
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

150
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,769
That was my first impression of the man.

151
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,396
What do you say

152
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,899
That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass.

153
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,235
That guy

154
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,235
Never happen.

155
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,696
Ten cigarettes

156
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,696
That's a rich bet.

157
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,990
Who's going to prove me wrong

158
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,992
Heywood

159
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,992
Jigger

160
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,577
Skeets

161
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,120
Floyd

162
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,123
Four brave souls.

163
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,084
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

164
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,588
All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.

165
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,151
Turn to the right

166
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,611
Eyes front.

167
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,293
This is Ms Hadley

168
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,293
He's captain of the guards.

169
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,587
I'm Ms Norton, the warden.

170
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,006
You are convicted felons.

171
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,300
That's why they've sent you to me

172
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,300
Rule number one:

173
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,970
No blasphemy.

174
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,891
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison.

175
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,309
The other rules

176
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,813
you'll figure out as you go along

177
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,813
Any questions

178
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,231
When do we eat

179
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,950
You eat when we say you eat.

180
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,411
You shit when we say you shit, and piss when we say you piss.

181
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,456
You got that, you maggot dick motherfucker

182
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,709
On your feet

183
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,709
I believe in two things:

184
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,339
Discipline and the Bible.

185
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,925
Here, you'll receive both.

186
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,845
Put your trust in the Lord.

187
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,681
Your ass belongs to me.

188
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,434
Welcome to Shawshank.

189
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,941
Unhook them.

190
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,781
Turn around.

191
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,039
That's enough.

192
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,959
Move to the end of the cage.

193
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,462
Turn around

194
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,462
Delouse him.

195
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,883
Turn around.

196
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,430
Move out of the cage

197
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,430
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

198
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,973
Next man up

199
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,978
To the right

200
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,978
Right

201
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,978
Right.

202
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,771
Left.

203
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,984
The first night's the toughest

204
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,984
No doubt about it.

205
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,529
They march you in naked as the day you were born

206
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,533
skin burning and half blind from that delousing shit.

207
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,620
And when they put you in that cell

208
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,164
and those bars slam home

209
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,833
that's when you know it's for real.

210
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,420
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

211
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:27,008
Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.

212
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,512
Most new fish come close to madness the first night.

213
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,766
Somebody always breaks down crying.

214
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,935
Happens every time.

215
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,646
The only question is

216
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,606
who's it going to be

217
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,944
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

218
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,697
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

219
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,375
Lights out

220
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,231
I remember my first night.

221
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,985
Seems like a long time ago.

222
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,823
Hey, fish.

223
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,659
Fish, fish.

224
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,996
What are you, scared of the dark

225
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,042
Bet you wish your daddy never dicked your mama

226
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,671
Piggy

227
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,671
Pork

228
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,671
I want me a pork chop.

229
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,846
Poke your ass out, give me a first look

230
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,846
Keep it down.

231
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,266
The boys always go fishing with first timers.

232
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,519
And they don't quit till they reel someone in.

233
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,522
Hey, Fat Ass.

234
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,358
Fat Ass

235
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,278
Talk to me, boy.

236
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,656
I know you're there

237
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,656
I can hear you breathing.

238
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,826
Don't you listen to these nitwits, you hear me

239
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,953
This place ain't so bad.

240
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,621
Tell you what

241
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,959
I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home.

242
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,546
I know a couple of big old bull queers that'd just

243
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,715
love to make your acquaintance.

244
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,427
Especially that big, white, mushy butt of yours.

245
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,720
God

246
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,805
I don't belong here

247
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,808
We have a winner

248
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,808
I want to go home

249
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,770
And it's Fat Ass by a nose

250
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,276
Fresh fish

251
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,276
Fresh fish

252
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,276
Fresh fish

253
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,653
I don't belong here.

254
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,240
I want to go home

255
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,451
I want my mother

256
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,828
I had your mother

257
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,828
She wasn't that great

258
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,251
What the Christ is this horseshit

259
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,545
He blasphemed

260
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,545
I'll tell the warden.

261
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,973
You'll tell him with my baton up your ass

262
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:13,174
You gotta let me out

263
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,803
What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk

264
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,014
Please

265
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,014
I ain't supposed to be here.

266
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,557
Not me

267
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,102
I won't count to three

268
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,102
Not even to one.

269
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,354
You shut up, or I'll sing you a lullaby

270
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,565
Shut up, man

271
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,565
Shut up

272
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,565
There's been a mistake.

273
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,985
You don't understand

274
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,985
I'm not supposed to be here.

275
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,487
Open that cell.

276
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,949
Me neither

277
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,949
They run this place like a fucking prison

278
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,458
Son of a bitch

279
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,715
Captain, take it easy

280
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,366
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here tonight

281
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,995
I swear by God and Jesus, you will all visit the infirmary.

282
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,831
Every last motherfucker in here.

283
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,921
Call the trustees

284
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,921
Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

285
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,899
His first night in the joint, Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

286
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,110
He never made a sound.

287
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,794
Tier 3 north, clear count

288
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,756
Tier 2 north, clear

289
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,756
Tier 2 south, clear.

290
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,383
Tier 3 south, clear.

291
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,638
Tier 1 south, clear

292
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,638
Tier 4 south, clear.

293
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,806
Prepare to roll out.

294
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,895
Roll out

295
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,993
Are you going to eat that

296
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,912
I hadn't planned on it.

297
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,206
Do you mind

298
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,216
That's nice and ripe.

299
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,022
Jake says thank you.

300
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,692
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

301
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,488
I'm going to look after him until he's big enough to fly.

302
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,408
Oh, no

303
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,408
Here he comes.

304
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,204
Morning, fellas.

305
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,373
Fine morning, isn't it

306
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,917
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you

307
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,420
Send them down

308
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,420
I want them lined up

309
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,256
just like a pretty little chorus line.

310
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,592
Look at that.

311
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,262
I can't stand this guy

312
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,262
Oh, Lord

313
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,432
Yes

314
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,432
Richmond, Virginia.

315
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,975
Smell my ass

316
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,186
After he smells mine.

317
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,315
That's a shame about your horse coming in last and all.

318
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,360
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine, though.

319
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,571
I owe that boy a big kiss when I see him.

320
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,950
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes instead

321
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,950
Lucky fuck

322
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,786
Hey, Tyrell.

323
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,121
You pull infirmary duty this week

324
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,665
How's my horse doing anyway

325
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,209
Dead.

326
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,253
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

327
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,631
Doc had gone home for the night.

328
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,425
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

329
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,095
By then, there wasn't nothing we could do.

330
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,685
What was his name

331
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,315
What'd you say

332
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,653
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

333
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,073
What the fuck do you care, new fish

334
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,202
Doesn't fucking matter what his name was

335
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,202
He's dead.

336
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,268
Anybody come at you yet

337
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,230
Anybody get to you yet

338
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,443
Hey, we all need friends in here.

339
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,403
I could be a friend to you.

340
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,038
Hard to get.

341
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,625
I like that.

342
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,802
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

343
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,096
I guess he had a lot on his mind

344
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,391
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

345
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,312
Wasn't until a month went by before he opened his mouth

346
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,898
to say more than two words to somebody.

347
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,650
As it turned out

348
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,986
that somebody was me.

349
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,538
I'm Andy Dufresne.

350
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,500
Wife killing banker.

351
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,086
Why'd you do it

352
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,589
I didn't, since you ask.

353
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,008
You're going to fit right in.

354
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,928
Everybody in here's innocent

355
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,928
Didn't you know that

356
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,765
What you in here for

357
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,765
Didn't do it

358
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,765
Lawyer fucked me.

359
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,354
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

360
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,149
You think your shit smells sweeter than most

361
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,149
Is that right

362
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,817
What do you think

363
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,279
To tell you the truth, I haven't made up my mind.

364
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,200
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

365
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,454
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time.

366
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,249
I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.

367
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,251
A rock hammer.

368
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,295
What is it and why

369
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,295
What do you care

370
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,341
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask

371
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,341
I'd quote a price.

372
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,969
But a toothbrush is a non lethal object, isn't it

373
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,972
Fair enough.

374
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,016
A rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.

375
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,561
Looks like a miniature pickax

376
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,561
Pickax

377
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,979
For rocks.

378
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,816
Quartz

379
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,198
And some mica, shale

380
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,701
limestone.

381
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,077
So

382
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,830
So I'm a rock hound.

383
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,375
At least I was in my old life

384
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,375
I'd like to be again.

385
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,795
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy into somebody's skull.

386
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,840
No, I have no enemies here.

387
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,342
No

388
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,342
Wait a while.

389
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,554
Word gets around.

390
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,724
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

391
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,893
Especially Bogs.

392
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,356
Don't suppose it would help if I told them I'm not homosexual.

393
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,983
Neither are they.

394
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,653
You have to be human first

395
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,653
They don't qualify.

396
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,537
Bull queers take by force

397
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,537
That's all they want or understand.

398
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,291
If I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

399
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,252
Thanks for the advice

400
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,252
Well, that's free.

401
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,546
You understand my concern.

402
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,382
If there's trouble, I won't use the rock hammer.

403
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:20,346
Then I'd guess you want to escape

404
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:20,346
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

405
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,890
What did I miss

406
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,890
What's so funny

407
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,018
You'll understand when you see the rock hammer.

408
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,064
What's an item like this usually go for

409
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,775
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

410
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,736
My normal markup's 20 percent.

411
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,322
But this is a specialty item.

412
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:42,993
Risk goes up, price goes up

413
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:42,993
Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

414
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,536
Ten it is.

415
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,290
Waste of money, if you ask me.

416
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,875
Why's that

417
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,296
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

418
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,883
They find it, you're going to lose it.

419
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,177
If they catch you, you don't know me.

420
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,596
Mention my name, we never do business again.

421
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,225
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum

422
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,225
Now you got that

423
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,602
I understand.

424
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,148
Thank you, Ms.

425
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,148
Red.

426
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,192
Name's Red.

427
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,278
Why do they call you that

428
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,034
Maybe it's because I'm lrish.

429
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,087
I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.

430
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,382
He had a quiet way about him

431
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,886
a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.

432
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,680
He strolled

433
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:49,101
like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world.

434
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,981
Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.

435
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,152
I think it would be fair to say

436
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,654
I liked Andy from the start.

437
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,993
Let's go

438
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,993
Some of us got a schedule to keep.

439
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,832
Move it

440
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,832
Come on, move it

441
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,337
How you doing

442
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,337
How's the wife treating you

443
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,976
Keep it moving.

444
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,023
Red.

445
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,960
Andy was right.

446
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,421
I finally got the joke.

447
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,132
It would take a man about 600 years

448
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,802
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

449
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,016
Book

450
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,016
Not today.

451
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,066
Book

452
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,066
No.

453
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,574
Delivery for Dufresne.

454
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,878
Book

455
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,844
Dufresne, here's your book.

456
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,100
Thanks.

457
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:03,068
We're running low on hexite

458
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:03,068
Get on back and fetch us up some.

459
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,940
This will blind you.

460
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,693
Honey, hush.

461
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,207
That's it

462
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,207
You fight

463
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,876
Better that way.

464
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,220
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight

465
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,431
and the Sisters let him be.

466
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,850
I wish I could tell you that

467
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,020
but prison is no fairy tale world.

468
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,106
He never said who did it.

469
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,942
But we all knew.

470
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,282
Things went on like that for a while.

471
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,202
Prison life consists of routine

472
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,412
and then more routine.

473
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,460
Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

474
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,755
The Sisters kept at him.

475
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,049
Sometimes he was able to fight them off.

476
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,759
Sometimes not.

477
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,096
And that's how it went for Andy.

478
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,431
That was his routine.

479
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,727
I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.

480
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,564
And I also believe if things had gone on that way

481
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,359
this place would have got the best of him.

482
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,904
But then, in the spring of 1949..

483
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,904
the powers that be decided:

484
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,576
The roof of the license plate factory needs resurfacing.

485
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,955
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

486
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,124
As you know

487
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:26,420
special detail carries with it special privileges.

488
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,047
It was outdoor detail

489
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,719
and May is one damned fine month to be working outdoors.

490
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,262
Stay in line there.

491
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,640
More than 100 men volunteered for the job.

492
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,939
Wallace E

493
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,939
Unger.

494
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,775
Ellis Redding.

495
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,569
Wouldn't you know it

496
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,281
Me and some fellows I know were among the names called.

497
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,491
Andrew Dufresne.

498
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,828
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

499
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,789
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

500
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,460
So this big shot lawyer calls me long distance from Texas

501
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,460
I say, Yeah

502
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,460
He says, Sorry to inform you, but your brother just died.

503
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:16,261
I'm sorry to hear that

504
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:16,261
I'm not

505
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:16,261
He was an asshole.

506
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,638
Ran off years ago

507
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,638
Figured him for dead

508
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,638
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

509
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,479
He died a rich man. Oil wells and shit

510
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,479
Close to a million bucks.

511
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,023
A million bucks

512
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:32,819
Incredible how lucky some assholes get

513
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:32,819
You going to see any of that

514
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,198
Thirty five thousand

515
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,198
That's what he left me.

516
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,158
Dollars

517
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,158
Yep.

518
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,328
That's great

519
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,328
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

520
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,829
Isn't it

521
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,957
Dumb shit, what do you think the government will do to me

522
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,502
Take a big wet bite out of my ass is what.

523
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,629
Poor Byron.

524
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,674
Terrible fucking luck, huh

525
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,674
Crying shame.

526
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,177
Some people really got it awful.

527
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,804
Andy, are you nuts

528
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,889
Keep your eyes on your mop, man

529
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,059
You'll pay some tax, but you'll still end up

530
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,062
Yeah, maybe enough to buy a new car, and then what

531
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,439
I got to pay tax on the car

532
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,439
Repair

533
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,401
maintenance, kids pestering you to take them for a ride all the time.

534
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,322
Then if you figure your tax wrong, you pay out of your own pocket.

535
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,658
I tell you

536
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,658
Uncle Sam

537
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,870
He puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

538
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,708
Getting himself killed

539
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,708
Keep tarring.

540
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,461
Some brother

541
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,461
Shit

542
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,801
Ms Hadley

543
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,053
do you trust your wife

544
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,140
Oh, that's funny.

545
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,351
You'll look funnier sucking my dick with no teeth.

546
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,855
What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back

547
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,401
Step aside, Mert

548
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,401
This fucker's having himself an accident.

549
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,694
He'll push him off

550
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,737
If you trust her, you can keep

551
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,322
that 35,000.

552
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,243
What did you say

553
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,243
Thirty five thousand.

554
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,411
All of it.

555
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,706
Every penny

556
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,706
You better start making sense.

557
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,250
If you want to keep it, give it to your wife.

558
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:14,337
The IRS allows a one time only gift to your spouse for up to $60,000.

559
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,923
Bullshit

560
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,923
Tax free

561
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,923
Tax free.

562
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,092
IRS can't touch one cent.

563
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,928
You're that smart banker what killed his wife.

564
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,557
Why should I believe you

565
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,557
So I can end up in here with you

566
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,602
It's legal

567
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,602
Ask the IRS

568
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,602
They'll say the same thing.

569
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,856
I feel stupid telling you this

570
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,856
I'm sure you would have investigated.

571
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,735
I don't need you to tell me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

572
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,322
Of course not

573
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,322
But you do need someone to set it up for you.

574
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,115
That'll cost you

575
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,115
A lawyer.

576
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,576
A bunch of ball washing bastards

577
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,496
I suppose I could set it up for you

578
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,496
That would save you some money.

579
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,790
You get the forms, I'll prepare them

580
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,751
nearly free of charge.

581
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:57,297
I'd only ask three beers apiece for each of my coworkers.

582
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,799
Coworkers. That's rich

583
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,136
A man working outdoors feels more like a man

584
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,806
if he can have a bottle of suds

585
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,806
That's only my opinion

586
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,266
sir.

587
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,147
What are you jimmies staring at

588
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,941
Let's go

589
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,941
Work

590
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,369
And that's how it came to pass

591
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,247
that on the second to last day of the job

592
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:35,001
the convict crew that tarred the factory roof in the spring of '49

593
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,338
wound up sitting in a row at 10:00 in the morning

594
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:44,010
drinking icy cold beer, courtesy of the hardest screw

595
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,514
that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

596
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,141
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

597
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:55,814
The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.

598
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,403
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.

599
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,198
We could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses.

600
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,243
We were the lords of all creation.

601
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,412
As for Andy

602
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,290
he spent that break hunkered in the shade

603
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,001
a strange little smile on his face

604
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,420
watching us drink his beer.

605
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,887
Want a cold one

606
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,516
No, thanks

607
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,516
I gave up drinking.

608
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,565
You could argue he'd done it to curry favor with the guards.

609
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:43,069
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

610
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,863
Me

611
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,866
I think he did it just to feel normal again

612
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,535
if only for a short while.

613
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,247
King me.

614
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,752
Chess

615
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,752
Now there's a game of kings

616
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,752
What

617
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,712
Civilized

618
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,712
Strategic.

619
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,382
And a total fucking mystery

620
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,382
I hate it.

621
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,426
Let me teach you someday.

622
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:08,928
Sure.

623
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,139
We could get a board together.

624
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,434
You're talking to the right man

625
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,434
I can get things, right

626
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:18,646
We might do business on a board, and I'll carve the pieces myself.

627
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,150
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone

628
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,150
What do you think

629
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,152
I think it'll take years.

630
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,905
Years I got

631
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,905
What I don't have are the rocks.

632
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,074
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

633
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,117
Pebbles, mostly.

634
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,249
We're getting to be kind of friends, aren't we

635
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,668
Yeah, I guess.

636
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,837
Can I ask you something

637
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,757
Why'd you do it

638
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,551
I'm innocent, Red.

639
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,804
Just like everybody else here.

640
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,684
What are you in for

641
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,564
Murder

642
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,564
Same as you.

643
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,941
Innocent

644
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,029
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

645
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,882
Where's the canary

646
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,383
How did you know

647
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,886
How did I know what

648
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,886
So you don't know.

649
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,220
Come.

650
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,850
This is where the canary is.

651
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,856
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing in my house, eh

652
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,736
That's quite a

653
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,363
surprise.

654
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,077
Wait, wait.

655
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,079
Here she comes.

656
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,249
I like this part when she does that shit with her hair.

657
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,169
I know

658
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,169
I've seen it three times this month.

659
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,254
Gilda, are you decent

660
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,423
Me

661
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,886
God, I love it.

662
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,061
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

663
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,774
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time

664
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,774
What do you want

665
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,109
Rita Hayworth

666
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,109
What

667
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,070
Can you get her

668
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,824
So this is Johnny Farrel

669
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,824
I've heard a lot about you.

670
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,370
Take a few weeks

671
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,370
Weeks

672
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,958
I don't have her stuffed down the front of my pants right now, sorry to say.

673
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,876
But I'll get her.

674
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,419
Relax.

675
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,589
Thanks.

676
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,945
Take a walk

677
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,945
I got to change reels

678
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,155
I said fuck off

679
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,663
Ain't you going to scream

680
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,874
Let's get this over with.

681
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,007
He broke my fucking nose

682
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,517
Now

683
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,186
I'm going to open my fly

684
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,189
and you'll swallow what I give you to swallow.

685
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,943
Then you'll swallow Rooster's

686
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,943
You broke his nose.

687
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,279
He ought to have something to show for it.

688
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,364
You put it in my mouth, you lose it.

689
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,159
No, you don't understand.

690
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,537
Do that and I'll put all eight inches of this in your ear.

691
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:48,207
All right, but you should know that sudden, serious brain injury

692
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,335
causes the victim to bite down hard.

693
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,047
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong

694
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,300
they have to pry the victim's jaws open

695
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,885
with a crowbar.

696
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,389
Where do you get this shit

697
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:04,974
I read it.

698
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:09,062
You know how to read, you ignorant fuck

699
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,023
Honey.

700
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,485
You shouldn't

701
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,074
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth.

702
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,409
And neither did his friends.

703
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,664
What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life.

704
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,833
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

705
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,170
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

706
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,759
Time's up, Bogs.

707
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,264
It's your world, boss.

708
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,312
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

709
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,190
All prisoners report for lockdown.

710
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,123
What

711
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,304
Where's he going

712
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,304
Grab his ankles.

713
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:32,395
No

714
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:32,395
No

715
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:32,395
Help me

716
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,651
Two things never happened again after that.

717
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,071
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again.

718
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,408
And Bogs never walked again.

719
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,079
They transferred him to a minimum security hospital upstate.

720
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,790
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days

721
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,084
drinking his food through a straw.

722
00:45:56,086 --> 00:46:00,173
Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.

723
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,509
Sounds good to us.

724
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,262
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

725
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,265
The man likes to play chess.

726
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,684
Let's get him some rocks.

727
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,551
Guys

728
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,386
I got one.

729
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,055
I got one

730
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,055
Look

731
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:55,061
Heywood, that isn't soapstone

732
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:55,061
And it ain't alabaster either.

733
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,146
What are you, a fucking geologist

734
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,065
He's right

735
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,065
It ain't.

736
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,193
What the hell is it then

737
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,193
It's a horse apple.

738
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,571
Bullshit

739
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,571
No, horseshit.

740
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,240
Petrified.

741
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,747
Oh, Jesus.

742
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,416
Damn

743
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,963
Despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style.

744
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,173
And by the weekend he was due back

745
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:28,094
we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till rapture.

746
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,430
Also got a big shipment in that week.

747
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,058
Cigarettes..

748
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,058
chewing gum

749
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,726
sipping whisky

750
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,313
playing cards with naked ladies on them

751
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,313
You name it

752
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,313
And, of course, the most important item:

753
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,195
Rita Hayworth herself.

754
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,107
Okay, look alive

755
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,107
Open all tiers.

756
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,568
Heads up

757
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,568
They're tossing cells.

758
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,487
Heads up

759
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,487
They're tossing cells

760
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,574
119.

761
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,077
123.

762
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,339
On your feet.

763
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,509
Face the wall.

764
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,545
Turn around and face the warden.

765
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,221
Pleased to see you reading this.

766
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,474
Any favorite passages

767
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,727
Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not..

768
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,727
when the master of the house cometh.

769
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,441
Mark 13:35.

770
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,069
I've always liked that one

771
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,069
But I prefer:

772
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,991
I am the light of the world

773
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,991
Ye that followeth me shall have the light of life.

774
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,580
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

775
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,916
I hear you're good with numbers.

776
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,084
How nice.

777
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,254
Man should have a skill.

778
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:11,841
Explain this.

779
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,096
It's called a rock blanket

780
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,096
For shaping and polishing rocks.

781
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,432
A little hobby of mine.

782
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,736
It's pretty clean.

783
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,114
Some contraband here, but nothing to get in a twist over.

784
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,454
I can't say I approve of this.

785
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,540
But I suppose

786
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,627
exceptions can be made.

787
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,306
Lock them up

788
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,810
I almost forgot.

789
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,396
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

790
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,066
Salvation lies within.

791
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,317
Yes, sir.

792
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,453
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

793
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,832
Truth is..

794
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,832
Norton wanted to size Andy up.

795
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,848
My wife made that in church group.

796
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,811
Very nice, sir.

797
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,855
You enjoy working the laundry

798
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,192
No, sir

799
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,192
Not especially.

800
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,986
Perhaps we can find something more

801
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,697
befitting a man of your education.

802
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,249
Hey, Jake

803
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,249
Where's Brooks

804
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,878
I thought I heard you out here.

805
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,089
I've been reassigned to you.

806
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,716
I know, they told me.

807
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,594
Ain't that a kick in the head

808
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,097
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

809
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,473
Come on.

810
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,601
Well, here she is.

811
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,812
The Shawshank Prison Library.

812
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,481
National Geographics

813
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,193
Reader's Digest condensed books

814
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,987
and Louis L'Amour.

815
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,406
Look magazine.

816
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,075
Erle Stanley Gardners.

817
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,787
Every evening I load up the cart and make my rounds.

818
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,665
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

819
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,918
Easy, peasy, Japanese y.

820
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,547
Any questions

821
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,547
How long have you been librarian

822
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:01,760
I come here in '05, and they made me librarian in 1912.

823
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,264
And have you ever had an assistant

824
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,933
No

825
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,933
Not much to it, really.

826
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,935
Why me

827
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,935
Why now

828
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,645
I don't know.

829
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,899
But it'd be nice to have some company down here.

830
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,454
That's him

831
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,454
That's the one.

832
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,254
I'm Dekins.

833
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,298
I was

834
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:43,802
thinking about setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

835
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,183
I see.

836
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,274
Why don't we have a seat and talk it over.

837
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,447
Do you have a piece of paper and a pencil

838
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,085
Thanks.

839
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,836
So

840
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,340
Ms Dekins..

841
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,340
And then Andy says, Ms Dekins

842
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,340
do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale

843
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,722
He didn't say that

844
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,558
As God as my witness

845
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,560
Dekins blinked for a second

846
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,897
then he laughed and actually shook Andy's hand.

847
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,692
My ass

848
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,692
Shook his hand.

849
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,736
I tell you, I near soiled myself

850
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:47,199
All he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk

851
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,035
he'd have been Ms Dufresne, if you please.

852
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,870
Making a few friends

853
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,870
I wouldn't say friends.

854
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:58,877
I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.

855
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,380
It's a wonderful pet to have.

856
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,382
Got you out of the laundry, though.

857
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,843
It might do more than that.

858
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,762
How about expanding the library

859
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,762
Get some new books.

860
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,557
If you ask for something, ask for a pool table.

861
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,270
How do you expect to do that

862
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,270
I mean..

863
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,270
get new books in here, Ms Dufresne, if you please.

864
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,984
I'll ask the warden for funds.

865
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:27,114
Six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned..

866
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:27,114
one immutable, universal truth:

867
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,202
Not one of them born whose asshole

868
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:36,415
wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.

869
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,210
The budget's stretched thin as it is

870
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,210
I see.

871
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,839
Perhaps I could write the state senate and request funds from them

872
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,839
They have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:

873
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,763
More walls, more bars, more guards.

874
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,640
I'd like to try, with permission

875
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,640
A letter a week.

876
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,602
They can't ignore me forever

877
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,602
Sure can.

878
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,521
But you write your letters if it makes you happy.

879
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,441
I'll even mail them for you

880
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,441
How's that

881
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,904
So Andy started writing a letter a week

882
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,697
just like he said.

883
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,496
And, just like Norton said

884
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,164
Andy got no answers.

885
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:30,302
The following April, Andy did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.

886
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,889
Year after that, he did them all

887
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,058
including the warden's.

888
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,271
Year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season

889
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,899
to coincide with tax season.

890
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:49,947
The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W 2s.

891
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,490
So Moresby Prison

892
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,951
issued you a gun, but you paid for it.

893
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,869
Right

894
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,869
The holster too.

895
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,539
That's tax deductible

896
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,539
You can write that off.

897
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,792
Yes, sir

898
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,792
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

899
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:07,005
In fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.

900
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,716
Could you hand me a stack of 1040s

901
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:14,763
Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.

902
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:19,184
And still, he kept sending those letters.

903
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:26,984
It's Brooks.

904
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,611
Watch the door.

905
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,196
Please, Brooks.

906
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,240
Calm the fuck down

907
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,240
Stay back

908
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,326
Stay back, goddamn it

909
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,326
What's going on

910
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,079
One second he's fine, then out come the knife.

911
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,081
We can talk about this, right

912
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:45,085
There's nothing to talk about

913
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:45,085
I'll cut his fucking throat.

914
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,087
What's he done to you

915
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,964
It's what they done

916
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,716
I got no choice.

917
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,510
You won't hurt Heywood

918
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,510
We all know that.

919
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,180
Right, Heywood

920
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,180
Sure

921
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,180
I know that.

922
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,725
He's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.

923
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,101
Right, guys

924
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,563
So put the knife down

925
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,563
Brooks, look at me.

926
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,065
Put the knife down.

927
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,069
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

928
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,156
Look at his neck

929
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,156
He's bleeding.

930
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,533
It's the only

931
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,785
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

932
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,413
This is crazy

933
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,413
You don't want to do this.

934
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,749
Put it..

935
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,749
Put it down.

936
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,009
Take it easy.

937
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,261
You'll be all right.

938
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,889
Him

939
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,889
What about me

940
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,475
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat

941
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,602
You've had worse from shaving.

942
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,896
What did you do to set him off

943
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,315
Nothing

944
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,315
I come in here to say farewell.

945
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,610
Ain't you heard

946
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,610
His parole's come through.

947
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,740
I just don't understand what happened in there, that's all.

948
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,743
Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.

949
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,828
That's enough out of you.

950
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,790
Heard he had you shitting your pants

951
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,790
Fuck you.

952
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,250
Knock it off.

953
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,627
Brooks ain't no bug.

954
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,258
He's just institutionalized.

955
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,553
Institutionalized, my ass.

956
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:21,765
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years

957
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,684
This is all he knows.

958
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,186
In here, he's an important man

959
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,479
an educated man.

960
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,232
Outside, he's nothing.

961
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:34,611
Just a used up con with arthritis in both hands.

962
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,823
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

963
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,825
You know what I'm trying to say

964
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,995
I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

965
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,498
You believe whatever you want.

966
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,501
But I tell you these walls are funny.

967
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,754
First you hate them.

968
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,508
Then you get used to them.

969
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,429
Enough time passes

970
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,098
you get so you depend on them

971
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,098
That's institutionalized.

972
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,811
Shit.

973
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,772
I could never get like that

974
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,772
Oh, yeah

975
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:14,151
Wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.

976
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,944
Goddamn right.

977
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,449
They send you here for life

978
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,452
that's exactly what they take.

979
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:27,205
Part that counts, anyway.

980
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,716
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

981
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,552
You go on now.

982
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:46,141
You're free.

983
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,828
Good luck, Brooksie.

984
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,208
Take care of yourself, Brooks

985
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,208
Dear fellas:

986
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:50,789
I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.

987
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,751
Watch it, old timer

988
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,751
Want to get killed

989
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,464
I saw an automobile once when I was a kid

990
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,551
but now they're everywhere.

991
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:10,517
The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.

992
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:30,120
The parole board got me into this halfway house

993
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,457
called The Brewer..

994
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,457
and a job

995
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,626
bagging groceries at the Food Way.

996
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,589
It's hard work and I try to keep up

997
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,175
but my hands hurt most of the time.

998
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,427
Make sure your man double bags.

999
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,679
Last time, the bottom near came out.

1000
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,266
Make sure you double bag like the lady says

1001
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,266
Understand

1002
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,851
Yes, sir

1003
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,851
Surely will.

1004
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,563
I don't think the store manager likes me very much.

1005
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:03,862
Sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.

1006
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,822
I keep thinking

1007
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,367
Jake might just show up and say hello.

1008
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:11,995
But he never does.

1009
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:18,043
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.

1010
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:24,382
I have trouble sleeping at night.

1011
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:27,969
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

1012
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,472
I wake up scared.

1013
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:34,893
Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.

1014
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:41,316
Maybe I should get me a gun and rob the Food Way so they'd send me home.

1015
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:45,946
I could shoot the manager while I was at it

1016
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:45,946
Sort of like a bonus.

1017
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:51,618
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.

1018
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,578
I don't like it here.

1019
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:57,791
I'm tired of being afraid all the time

1020
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:57,791
I've decided

1021
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,293
not to stay.

1022
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,765
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss

1023
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,477
not for an old crook like me

1024
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,477
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss, not for an old crook like me.

1025
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:29,090
P.S

1026
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:29,090
Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat

1027
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:29,090
No hard feelings

1028
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:29,090
Brooks.

1029
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,064
He should have died in here.

1030
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,029
What the fuck have you done

1031
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,865
It's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.

1032
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:03,166
What's all this

1033
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:03,166
You tell me

1034
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:03,166
They're addressed to you.

1035
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:05,752
Take it

1036
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:05,752
Dear Ms Dufresne:

1037
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,890
In response to your repeated inquiries..

1038
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,890
the state has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project.

1039
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,981
This is $200

1040
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,981
In addition, the library district has generously responded

1041
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,946
with a donation of used books and sundries.

1042
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:37,283
We trust this will fill your needs

1043
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:37,283
We now consider the matter closed

1044
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:37,283
Please stop sending us letters.

1045
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:42,205
Clear all this out before the warden gets back.

1046
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,581
Yes, sir.

1047
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,045
Good for you, Andy.

1048
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,261
It only took six years.

1049
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,598
From now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.

1050
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,102
I believe you're crazy enough

1051
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,102
Get this stuff out

1052
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,813
like he said

1053
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,813
I've got to pinch a loaf.

1054
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,481
When I come back

1055
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,442
this is all gone, all right

1056
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,617
Do you hear that

1057
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,520
Dufresne

1058
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:14,566
Andy, let me out

1059
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:26,411
I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.

1060
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,913
Truth is, I don't want to know.

1061
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,624
Some things are best left unsaid.

1062
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,922
I like to think it was something so beautiful

1063
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,258
it can't be expressed in words

1064
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:43,386
and makes your heart ache because of it.

1065
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:47,557
I tell you, those voices soared

1066
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:52,103
higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.

1067
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:55,690
It was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage

1068
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,651
and made those walls dissolve away.

1069
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,279
And for the briefest of moments

1070
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:04,490
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

1071
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:09,746
It pissed the warden off something awful.

1072
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,040
Open the door.

1073
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,711
Open it up

1074
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,757
Dufresne, open this door

1075
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:23,301
Turn that off

1076
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:32,810
I am warning you

1077
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:32,810
Turn that off

1078
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:52,080
You're mine now.

1079
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,757
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.

1080
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,550
On your feet.

1081
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:08,137
Hey, look who's here

1082
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:08,137
Maestro

1083
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:13,559
You couldn't play something good, huh

1084
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:13,559
Like Hank Williams

1085
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:16,688
They broke the door down before I could take requests.

1086
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:20,024
Was it worth two weeks

1087
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:20,024
Easiest time I ever did.

1088
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:24,445
No such thing as easy time in the hole

1089
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:24,445
A week in the hole is like a year.

1090
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:27,949
Damn straight

1091
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:27,949
I had Ms Mozart to keep me company.

1092
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:31,119
So they let you tote that record player down there, huh

1093
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,914
It was in here.

1094
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,000
In here.

1095
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,211
That's the beauty of music

1096
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,211
They

1097
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,755
can't get that from you.

1098
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,678
Haven't you ever felt that way about music

1099
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:53,599
Well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.

1100
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,352
Lost interest in it, though.

1101
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,146
Didn't make much sense in here.

1102
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,481
Here's where it makes the most sense.

1103
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,067
You need it so you don't forget.

1104
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,944
Forget

1105
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:09,949
Forget that there are..

1106
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:09,949
places

1107
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:14,287
in the world that aren't made out of stone.

1108
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,789
There's something

1109
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:18,541
inside

1110
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,752
that they can't get to

1111
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:22,378
that they can't touch.

1112
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,297
That's yours.

1113
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,425
What are you talking about

1114
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:32,096
Hope.

1115
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,059
Let me tell you something, my friend.

1116
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,145
Hope is a dangerous thing.

1117
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,648
Hope can drive a man insane.

1118
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,526
It's got no use on the inside.

1119
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,945
You'd better get used to that idea.

1120
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,949
Like Brooks did

1121
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:18,309
Sit down.

1122
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,943
Says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.

1123
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,154
You feel you've been rehabilitated

1124
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:31,614
Oh, yes, sir.

1125
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:34,200
Without a doubt.

1126
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,787
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1127
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,707
No danger to society here.

1128
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,793
God's honest truth.

1129
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:48,464
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1130
01:13:58,434 --> 01:13:59,767
Thirty years.

1131
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:03,646
Jesus, when you say it like that

1132
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,315
You wonder where it went.

1133
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:10,903
I wonder where 10 years went.

1134
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:16,909
Here.

1135
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:20,079
A little parole rejection present.

1136
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:23,040
Go ahead and open it.

1137
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,210
Went through one of your competitors.

1138
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:29,547
I hope you don't mind

1139
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:29,547
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1140
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,058
It's very pretty.

1141
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:43,978
Thank you.

1142
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,024
You going to play it

1143
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:53,863
No.

1144
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:58,868
Not right now.

1145
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:17,637
Roll in

1146
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,091
Lights out

1147
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,836
Andy was as good as his word.

1148
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,964
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

1149
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:41,137
In 1959, the state senate finally clued in to the fact

1150
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:44,515
they couldn't buy him off with just a $200 check.

1151
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:49,020
Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500

1152
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,105
just to shut him up.

1153
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:54,317
And you'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it.

1154
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:57,445
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

1155
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:00,406
He bought remaindered books by the pound

1156
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:02,450
Treasure Island.

1157
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:05,536
Robert Louis..

1158
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:05,536
Stevenson.

1159
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,163
Fiction, adventure.

1160
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:10,750
What's next

1161
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:14,003
I got here Auto Repair

1162
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:15,880
and Soap Carving.

1163
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:19,342
Trade skills and hobbies

1164
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:19,342
Under Educational, behind you.

1165
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:21,385
Count of Monte Crisco.

1166
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:24,180
That's Cristo, you dumb shit.

1167
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:26,265
By Alexandree

1168
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,017
Dum ass.

1169
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:29,393
Dumb ass.

1170
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:32,730
Dumb ass

1171
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,610
Dumas

1172
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,610
Know what that's about

1173
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,906
You'd like it

1174
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,906
It's about a prison break.

1175
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:45,951
We ought to file that under Educational too, oughtn't we

1176
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:50,915
The rest of us did our best to pitch in when and where we could.

1177
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,250
By the year Kennedy was shot

1178
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:58,005
Andy had transformed a storage room smelling of turpentine

1179
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:01,425
into the best prison library in New England

1180
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:05,054
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

1181
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:14,355
That was also when Warden Norton

1182
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:17,483
instituted his famous Inside Out program.

1183
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,027
You may remember reading about it.

1184
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:23,364
It made the papers and got his picture in Look magazine.

1185
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:24,907
It's no free ride

1186
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:28,285
but rather a genuine progressive advance

1187
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,996
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1188
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:33,874
Our inmates, properly supervised

1189
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:36,711
will be put to work outside these walls

1190
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,005
performing all manner of public service.

1191
01:18:40,173 --> 01:18:42,967
These men can learn the value of an honest day's labor

1192
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:46,971
while providing a valuable service to the community

1193
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:51,892
and at a bare minimum of expense to Ms and Mrs John Q

1194
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:51,892
Taxpayer.

1195
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,645
Of course he didn't tell the press

1196
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:58,315
that bare minimum of expense is a fairly loose term.

1197
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:01,569
There are 100 different ways to skim off the top.

1198
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:04,280
Men, materials, you name it.

1199
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:07,491
And oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in

1200
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,244
At this rate, you'll put me out of business.

1201
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:14,874
With this pool of slave labor, you can underbid any contractor in town.

1202
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,419
We're providing a valuable community service.

1203
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:22,298
That's fine for the papers, but I've got a family to feed.

1204
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:26,510
We go back a long way.

1205
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:32,725
I need this highway contract

1206
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:32,725
I don't get it and I go under

1207
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:32,725
That's a fact.

1208
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:35,436
You have some of this fine pie

1209
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:39,023
my missus made for you

1210
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:39,023
You think about that.

1211
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:49,992
I wouldn't worry too much about this contract.

1212
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,287
It seems to me I already got my boys committed elsewhere.

1213
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:58,334
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

1214
01:19:59,419 --> 01:20:01,587
And behind every shady deal

1215
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:04,548
behind every dollar earned

1216
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:07,885
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1217
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,553
Two deposits.

1218
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:13,933
Maine National and New England First

1219
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:13,933
Night drops as always, sir.

1220
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:48,467
Get my stuff to the laundry

1221
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:48,467
Two suits for dry clean and a bag of whatnot.

1222
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:52,471
If they over starch my shirts again, they'll hear from me.

1223
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,014
How do I look

1224
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:57,560
Very nice

1225
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:57,560
Big charity to do up Portland way.

1226
01:20:57,769 --> 01:20:59,270
Governor will be there.

1227
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,147
You want the rest of this

1228
01:21:03,483 --> 01:21:05,442
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1229
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:07,987
Thank you, sir.

1230
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:14,076
He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1231
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:19,123
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of

1232
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:19,123
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1233
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,667
A river of dirty money running through here.

1234
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:25,713
Sooner or later, he'll have to explain where it came from.

1235
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:27,673
That's where I come in.

1236
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,593
I channel it

1237
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,593
Filter it

1238
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,593
Funnel it.

1239
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:33,637
Stocks, securities, tax free municipals.

1240
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:37,474
I send it out into the real world, and when it comes back

1241
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:40,644
Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh

1242
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:40,644
Cleaner.

1243
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:44,857
By the time Norton retires, I'll have made him a millionaire.

1244
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:51,530
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1245
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:54,491
I thought you had more faith in me than that.

1246
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,745
I know you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail.

1247
01:21:58,121 --> 01:21:59,955
Now anybody gets curious

1248
01:22:00,123 --> 01:22:02,541
FBI, IRS, whatever.

1249
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,293
It'll lead to somebody.

1250
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:08,339
Sure it is, but not to me, and certainly not to the warden.

1251
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:13,719
All right, who

1252
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,512
Randall Stevens.

1253
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,014
Who

1254
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,183
The silent silent partner.

1255
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:22,478
He's the guilty one, the man with the bank accounts.

1256
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:24,855
It's where the filtering process starts.

1257
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:27,900
They trace anything, it'll just lead to him.

1258
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:29,735
But who is he

1259
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:33,906
He's a phantom, an apparition

1260
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:33,906
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1261
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:37,743
I conjured him..

1262
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:37,743
out of thin air.

1263
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:41,288
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1264
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,710
You can't just make a person up.

1265
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,047
Sure you can, if you know how the system works.

1266
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:53,384
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1267
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:56,345
Ms Stevens has a birth certificate

1268
01:22:56,554 --> 01:22:58,681
driver's license, Social Security.

1269
01:22:58,932 --> 01:22:59,932
You're shitting me.

1270
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,519
If they trace any accounts, they'll wind up chasing

1271
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:05,437
a figment of my imagination.

1272
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,648
Well, I'll be damned

1273
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,734
Did I say you were good

1274
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,736
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1275
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:15,197
The funny thing is

1276
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:19,493
on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.

1277
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:22,246
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1278
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,423
Ever bother you

1279
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:36,927
I don't run the scams

1280
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:36,927
I just process the profits.

1281
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,179
A fine line, maybe

1282
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,807
but I also built that library

1283
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,060
and used it to help guys get their high school diploma.

1284
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,479
Why do you think he lets me do all that

1285
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,898
Keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1286
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:51,567
Money instead of sheets.

1287
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:54,528
Well, I work cheap

1288
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:54,528
That's the tradeoff.

1289
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:14,423
Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965

1290
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,884
on a two year stretch for B and E.

1291
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:19,470
That's breaking and entering to you.

1292
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:23,974
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.

1293
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:25,684
Young punk.

1294
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:29,271
Ms Rock 'n' Roll..

1295
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:29,271
cocky as hell.

1296
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,857
Come on, old boys

1297
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,857
Moving like molasses

1298
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:33,859
Making me look bad.

1299
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,861
We liked him immediately.

1300
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:39,823
I'm backing out the door and I got the TV like this.

1301
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,786
A big old thing

1302
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,786
I couldn't see shit

1303
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,786
Then I hear this voice

1304
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,786
Freeze, kid, hands in the air. I was standing there, holding onto that TV

1305
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,786
Finally the voice says:

1306
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:55,047
You hear what I said, boy

1307
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:55,047
I say, Yes, sir

1308
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:55,047
I did

1309
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:55,047
But if I drop this, you get me on destruction of property too.

1310
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:05,516
You done some stretch in Cashman, right

1311
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:09,978
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.

1312
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:12,189
Weekend furloughs

1313
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:12,189
Work programs.

1314
01:25:12,857 --> 01:25:14,149
Not like here.

1315
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:16,068
Sounds like you done time all over.

1316
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,904
I've been in and out since I was 13.

1317
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,323
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1318
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:24,201
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1319
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,204
What I mean is

1320
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,499
you're not a very good thief

1321
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,499
You should try something else.

1322
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:34,419
Yeah, what the hell you know about it, Capone

1323
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:36,421
What are you in for

1324
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:37,714
Me

1325
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,802
A lawyer fucked me.

1326
01:25:45,723 --> 01:25:48,684
Everybody's innocent in here

1327
01:25:45,723 --> 01:25:48,684
Don't you know that

1328
01:25:56,568 --> 01:26:00,988
As it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.

1329
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,699
Maybe he thought of them on the streets

1330
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:06,410
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

1331
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,078
Whatever it was

1332
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,831
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1333
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:17,546
Thought I might try for my high school equivalency.

1334
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:20,257
Hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1335
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,844
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1336
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,764
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1337
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:31,310
You mean that

1338
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:31,310
Yeah.

1339
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:34,438
You really mean that

1340
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,815
Yes, sir, I do.

1341
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,984
Good

1342
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,984
Because if we do this

1343
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:43,155
we do it all the way, a hundred percent, nothing half assed.

1344
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:45,199
Thing is, see

1345
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:47,993
I don't read so good

1346
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:47,993
Well.

1347
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,999
You don't read

1348
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,792
so well.

1349
01:26:58,129 --> 01:26:59,630
We'll get to that.

1350
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,178
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1351
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:09,014
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1352
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:13,352
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1353
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:16,396
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1354
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:22,152
Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.

1355
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:24,029
He really liked the kid.

1356
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,824
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.

1357
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,577
But that wasn't the only reason.

1358
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:33,497
Prison time is slow time.

1359
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:36,541
So you do what you can to keep going.

1360
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:38,961
Some fellas collect stamps.

1361
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:41,838
Others build matchstick houses.

1362
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:45,092
Andy built a library.

1363
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:47,511
Now he needed a new project.

1364
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:49,888
Tommy was it.

1365
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:54,518
It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.

1366
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:58,313
The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1367
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:00,482
In prison

1368
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:04,486
a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.

1369
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:10,117
By 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams

1370
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:12,536
it was lovely Raquel.

1371
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:30,095
Time.

1372
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:37,394
Well

1373
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,897
Well, it's for shit.

1374
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:44,234
I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.

1375
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:45,902
It's probably not that bad.

1376
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:50,365
I didn't get a thing right

1377
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:50,365
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1378
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:52,284
Let's see how the score comes out.

1379
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:55,454
I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.

1380
01:28:57,415 --> 01:28:58,749
Two points, right there

1381
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:00,542
There's your goddamn score

1382
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:04,463
Goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5 times 5 is 25

1383
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:07,049
Fuck this place

1384
01:29:07,258 --> 01:29:08,425
Fuck it

1385
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:28,820
I feel bad.

1386
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,238
I let him down.

1387
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:32,157
That's crap, kid.

1388
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:33,700
He's proud of you.

1389
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,912
We're old friends, I know him as good as anybody.

1390
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:38,663
Smart fellow, ain't he

1391
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:42,000
Smart as they come

1392
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:42,000
He was a banker on the outside.

1393
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,461
What's he in here for anyway

1394
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:45,754
Murder.

1395
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:48,590
The hell, you say.

1396
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:53,053
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1397
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:58,392
Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro

1398
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:58,392
Greased them both.

1399
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:07,776
What

1400
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:11,321
About four years ago

1401
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:14,825
I was in Thomaston on a two to three stretch.

1402
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:16,618
I stole a car.

1403
01:30:16,994 --> 01:30:18,995
It was a dumb fuck thing to do.

1404
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,873
About six months left to go

1405
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:24,084
I get a new cellmate in.

1406
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:26,420
Elmo Blatch.

1407
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,463
Big, twitchy fucker.

1408
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,843
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get

1409
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,843
You know what I'm saying

1410
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,762
Six to twelve, armed burglary.

1411
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:38,306
Said he pulled hundreds ofjobs.

1412
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:43,437
Hard to believe, high strung as he was

1413
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:43,437
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1414
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:49,151
Talked all the time too

1415
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:49,151
That's the other thing

1416
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:49,151
He never shut up.

1417
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,986
Places he'd been in

1418
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,364
jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1419
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,783
Even people he killed

1420
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,783
People who gave him shit.

1421
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,039
That's how he put it.

1422
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,711
So one night, like a joke..

1423
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,711
I say to him, Elmo, who did you kill

1424
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,711
So he says:

1425
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:17,804
I got me this job one time, busing tables at a country club

1426
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:22,392
so I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.

1427
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,480
So I pick out this guy

1428
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:30,901
go in one night..

1429
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:30,901
and do his place.

1430
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,653
He wakes up

1431
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:36,156
and gives me shit.

1432
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:38,909
So I killed him.

1433
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:43,497
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1434
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:47,167
And that's the best part.

1435
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:50,295
She's fucking this prick, see

1436
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,590
this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy.

1437
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,760
Some hotshot banker.

1438
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,680
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1439
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:16,029
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1440
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:19,783
What amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.

1441
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,535
Sir

1442
01:32:23,746 --> 01:32:27,332
It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.

1443
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:31,878
He hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1444
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:34,256
He's young, not terribly bright.

1445
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:38,218
It's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.

1446
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:40,178
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1447
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:45,141
Let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist

1448
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:45,141
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, Yes, I did it

1449
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:45,141
I confess. By the way, add a life term to my sentence.

1450
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,944
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1451
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:58,613
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1452
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,782
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1453
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:05,579
They'd have his last known address, names of relatives

1454
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:05,579
It's a chance, isn't it

1455
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,666
How can you be so obtuse

1456
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:11,835
What

1457
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:14,546
What did you call me

1458
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,506
Obtuse

1459
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,506
Is it deliberate

1460
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:18,341
You're forgetting yourself.

1461
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:21,636
The country club will have his old timecards.

1462
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,598
Records, W 2s with his name on them.

1463
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:27,517
If you want to indulge this fantasy, it's your business.

1464
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:30,312
Don't make it mine

1465
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:30,312
This meeting is over.

1466
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:33,106
If I got out, I'd never mention what happens here.

1467
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:36,693
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.

1468
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:41,531
Don't ever mention money to me again, you sorry son of a bitch

1469
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,366
Not in this office

1470
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,535
not anywhere

1471
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,535
Get in here, now

1472
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:48,455
I just wanted to put you at ease, that's all.

1473
01:33:49,081 --> 01:33:51,207
Solitary

1474
01:33:49,081 --> 01:33:51,207
A month

1475
01:33:49,081 --> 01:33:51,207
Yes, sir.

1476
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:54,169
What's the matter with you

1477
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:54,169
Get him out of here.

1478
01:33:54,378 --> 01:33:57,922
This is my chance to get out

1479
01:33:54,378 --> 01:33:57,922
It's my life

1480
01:33:54,378 --> 01:33:57,922
Don't you understand

1481
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:00,216
Get him out

1482
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:03,928
A month in the hole.

1483
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:06,848
That's the longest stretch I ever heard of.

1484
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:08,350
It's all my fault.

1485
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:10,143
Bullshit.

1486
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:13,521
You didn't pull the trigger or convict him.

1487
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:16,107
Are you saying Andy is innocent

1488
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,360
I mean, for real innocent

1489
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:19,903
It looks that way.

1490
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,238
Sweet Jesus.

1491
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,324
How long has he been here now

1492
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,994
1947

1493
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,994
What is that

1494
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,994
Nineteen years.

1495
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:30,830
Williams, Thomas

1496
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:30,830
Yeah, over here.

1497
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:37,837
What you got

1498
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:39,798
Board of Education.

1499
01:34:40,007 --> 01:34:41,549
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1500
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:45,720
You going to open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt

1501
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,098
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1502
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:51,434
Skeets, come on

1503
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:51,434
Give me that, you shithead.

1504
01:34:52,269 --> 01:34:53,603
Floyd, come on.

1505
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:01,444
Will you throw that away, please

1506
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:08,785
Well, shit.

1507
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:24,259
The kid passed

1508
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:24,259
C plus average.

1509
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:26,553
Thought you'd like to know.

1510
01:35:42,778 --> 01:35:44,237
Warden wants to talk.

1511
01:35:58,002 --> 01:35:59,043
Out here

1512
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:01,504
That's what the man said.

1513
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:18,855
Warden

1514
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:32,702
I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.

1515
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,456
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1516
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:56,976
We got a situation here.

1517
01:36:57,853 --> 01:36:59,938
I think you can appreciate that.

1518
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:01,397
Yes, sir.

1519
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,066
I sure can.

1520
01:37:03,317 --> 01:37:07,362
I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.

1521
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,407
It's got me up nights

1522
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,407
That's the truth.

1523
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:15,495
The right thing to do

1524
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:20,917
sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1525
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:23,336
Do you understand

1526
01:37:25,631 --> 01:37:27,257
I need your help, son.

1527
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:30,844
If I'm going to move on this

1528
01:37:31,178 --> 01:37:34,347
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1529
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:36,140
I have to know

1530
01:37:36,308 --> 01:37:38,977
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1531
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:40,311
Yes, sir.

1532
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:41,771
Absolutely.

1533
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:45,275
Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury

1534
01:37:45,442 --> 01:37:47,443
with your hand on the Good Book

1535
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:50,321
and take an oath before Almighty God himself

1536
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:52,323
Just give me that chance.

1537
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:57,954
That's what I thought.

1538
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:46,920
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1539
01:38:48,672 --> 01:38:49,714
Terrible thing.

1540
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:52,800
A man that young

1541
01:38:53,135 --> 01:38:55,720
less than a year to go, trying to escape.

1542
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:58,765
Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1543
01:38:59,516 --> 01:39:01,017
Truly, it did.

1544
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:06,439
We just have to put it behind us.

1545
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:09,359
Move on.

1546
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:12,445
I'm done.

1547
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:15,365
Everything stops.

1548
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:19,702
Get someone else to run your scams.

1549
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:22,789
Nothing stops.

1550
01:39:24,124 --> 01:39:25,500
Nothing.

1551
01:39:28,712 --> 01:39:31,798
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1552
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,550
No more protection from the guards.

1553
01:39:34,718 --> 01:39:39,639
I'll pull you out of that 1  bunk Hilton and cast you down with the sodomites.

1554
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:43,476
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1555
01:39:44,895 --> 01:39:46,396
And the library

1556
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:48,064
Gone.

1557
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:51,234
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1558
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:54,362
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

1559
01:39:54,571 --> 01:39:56,698
They'll see the flames for miles.

1560
01:39:56,907 --> 01:39:59,742
We'll dance around it like wild lnjuns.

1561
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:03,997
You understand me

1562
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:03,997
Catching my drift

1563
01:40:07,751 --> 01:40:09,585
Or am I being obtuse

1564
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:24,017
Give him another month to think about it.

1565
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:13,816
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1566
01:41:14,651 --> 01:41:16,486
Like a closed book.

1567
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:19,322
Complained about it all the time.

1568
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,824
She was beautiful.

1569
01:41:24,203 --> 01:41:26,037
God, I loved her.

1570
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,667
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1571
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:36,089
I killed her, Red.

1572
01:41:37,966 --> 01:41:39,759
I didn't pull the trigger

1573
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:42,929
but I drove her away.

1574
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:47,141
That's why she died, because of me

1575
01:41:47,309 --> 01:41:48,684
the way I am.

1576
01:41:57,694 --> 01:41:59,529
That don't make you a murderer.

1577
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:04,700
Bad husband, maybe.

1578
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:11,582
Feel bad about it if you want, but you didn't pull the trigger.

1579
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:13,126
No, I didn't.

1580
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,461
Somebody else did.

1581
01:42:16,713 --> 01:42:18,798
And I wound up in here.

1582
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,885
Bad luck, I guess.

1583
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:29,517
It floats around.

1584
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:32,770
It's got to land on somebody.

1585
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:35,565
It was my turn, that's all.

1586
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:39,068
I was in the path of the tornado.

1587
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,953
I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.

1588
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:55,001
Think you'll ever get out of here

1589
01:42:56,253 --> 01:42:57,670
Me

1590
01:43:00,257 --> 01:43:01,591
Yeah.

1591
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:04,886
One day, when I got a long, white beard

1592
01:43:05,095 --> 01:43:09,182
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1593
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:11,934
I tell you where I'd go.

1594
01:43:13,395 --> 01:43:15,104
Zihuatanejo.

1595
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:17,106
Say what

1596
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,275
Zihuatanejo.

1597
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:21,861
It's in Mexico.

1598
01:43:23,238 --> 01:43:25,364
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1599
01:43:26,491 --> 01:43:29,285
You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific

1600
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:33,122
They say it has no memory.

1601
01:43:35,083 --> 01:43:37,752
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1602
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:41,881
A warm place with no memory.

1603
01:43:45,135 --> 01:43:47,053
Open up a little hotel

1604
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,264
right on the beach.

1605
01:43:50,849 --> 01:43:53,059
Buy some worthless old boat

1606
01:43:53,602 --> 01:43:55,228
and fix it up new.

1607
01:43:57,981 --> 01:43:59,190
Take my guests out

1608
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:01,400
charter fishing.

1609
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:06,989
Zihuatanejo.

1610
01:44:10,494 --> 01:44:14,372
In a place like that, I could use a man that knows how to get things.

1611
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:23,756
I don't think I could make it on the outside.

1612
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:32,515
I been in here most of my life.

1613
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:35,685
I'm an institutional man now.

1614
01:44:36,603 --> 01:44:38,354
Just like Brooks was.

1615
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:41,524
You underestimate yourself.

1616
01:44:42,067 --> 01:44:43,693
I don't think so.

1617
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:51,450
In here I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure, but

1618
01:44:52,202 --> 01:44:54,745
outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1619
01:44:54,955 --> 01:44:57,206
Hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.

1620
01:44:59,334 --> 01:45:00,960
Pacific Ocean

1621
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:02,586
Shit.

1622
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:05,172
Scare me to death, something that big.

1623
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:06,674
Not me.

1624
01:45:07,884 --> 01:45:10,636
I didn't shoot my wife, and I didn't shoot her lover.

1625
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:15,599
Whatever mistakes I made, I've paid for them and then some.

1626
01:45:16,643 --> 01:45:18,144
That hotel, that boat

1627
01:45:19,896 --> 01:45:22,148
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1628
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:29,488
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1629
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:31,741
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1630
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,618
Mexico is way down there and you're in here

1631
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:36,412
and that's the way it is.

1632
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:39,582
Yeah, right

1633
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:39,582
That's the way it is.

1634
01:45:41,084 --> 01:45:43,461
It's down there and I'm in here.

1635
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:48,758
I guess it comes down to a simple choice.

1636
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:53,179
Get busy living

1637
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:56,599
or get busy dying.

1638
01:46:08,695 --> 01:46:11,447
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1639
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:13,908
Sure, Andy

1640
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:13,908
Anything.

1641
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:19,622
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton

1642
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:19,622
You know where Buxton is

1643
01:46:21,124 --> 01:46:24,251
A lot of hayfields up there

1644
01:46:21,124 --> 01:46:24,251
One in particular.

1645
01:46:24,461 --> 01:46:28,381
It's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.

1646
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:31,467
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1647
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,887
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1648
01:46:36,306 --> 01:46:38,391
We went there for a picnic

1649
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:40,893
and made love under that oak

1650
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:43,813
and I asked and she said yes.

1651
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:49,652
Promise me, Red.

1652
01:46:50,487 --> 01:46:53,823
If you ever get out..

1653
01:46:50,487 --> 01:46:53,823
find that spot.

1654
01:46:54,991 --> 01:46:59,829
At the base of that wall, there's a rock that has no earthly business in Maine.

1655
01:47:00,956 --> 01:47:03,999
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1656
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:09,338
Something's buried under it I want you to have.

1657
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:11,340
What, Andy

1658
01:47:11,758 --> 01:47:13,509
What's buried under there

1659
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:18,431
You'll have to pry it up..

1660
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:18,431
to see.

1661
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:26,272
No, I'm telling you

1662
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:26,272
The guy is

1663
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,691
He's talking funny.

1664
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:31,485
I'm really worried about him.

1665
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:33,320
Let's keep an eye on him.

1666
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:36,782
That's fine during the day, but at night he's all alone.

1667
01:47:38,201 --> 01:47:39,368
Oh, Lord.

1668
01:47:40,704 --> 01:47:42,288
What

1669
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:45,791
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1670
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:48,085
He asked me for a length of rope.

1671
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:51,005
Rope

1672
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:51,005
Six feet long.

1673
01:47:51,214 --> 01:47:52,590
And you gave it to him.

1674
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:55,259
Sure

1675
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:55,259
Why wouldn't I

1676
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:57,052
Jesus

1677
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:57,052
Heywood.

1678
01:47:57,637 --> 01:47:59,597
How was I supposed to know

1679
01:47:59,806 --> 01:48:01,390
Remember Brooks Hatlen

1680
01:48:03,393 --> 01:48:05,311
Andy would never do that.

1681
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:07,354
Never.

1682
01:48:09,065 --> 01:48:10,399
I don't know.

1683
01:48:13,236 --> 01:48:15,237
Every man has his breaking point.

1684
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:19,867
Lickety split

1685
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:19,867
Want to get home.

1686
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,911
Just about finished, sir.

1687
01:48:39,054 --> 01:48:40,679
Three deposits tonight.

1688
01:48:48,647 --> 01:48:50,564
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1689
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:52,399
And shine my shoes.

1690
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:55,528
I want them looking like mirrors

1691
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:55,528
Yes, sir.

1692
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:02,493
It's good having you back.

1693
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:05,287
Place wasn't the same without you.

1694
01:49:52,168 --> 01:49:53,544
Lights out

1695
01:50:26,077 --> 01:50:28,621
I've had some long nights in the stir.

1696
01:50:29,164 --> 01:50:31,832
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts

1697
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,710
time can draw out like a blade.

1698
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:43,052
That was the longest night of my life.

1699
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:00,069
Give me a count

1700
01:51:04,574 --> 01:51:07,409
Tier 3 south, clear

1701
01:51:10,538 --> 01:51:13,707
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245

1702
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:14,958
Dufresne

1703
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:17,920
Come out

1704
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:17,920
You're holding up the show

1705
01:51:21,091 --> 01:51:24,468
Don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you

1706
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:35,896
Damn it, you're putting me behind

1707
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:35,896
I got a schedule to keep.

1708
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:39,400
You'd better be sick or dead in there

1709
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:39,400
I shit you not

1710
01:51:39,609 --> 01:51:40,943
You hear me

1711
01:51:47,033 --> 01:51:49,118
Oh, my Holy God.

1712
01:52:06,136 --> 01:52:08,679
I want every man on this cellblock questioned.

1713
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:11,682
Start with that friend of his

1714
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:11,682
Who

1715
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:13,267
Him.

1716
01:52:14,269 --> 01:52:15,811
Open 237.

1717
01:52:19,315 --> 01:52:22,985
What do you mean, He just wasn't here

1718
01:52:19,315 --> 01:52:22,985
Don't say that to me.

1719
01:52:23,862 --> 01:52:26,447
Don't say that to me again

1720
01:52:23,862 --> 01:52:26,447
But, sir, he wasn't.

1721
01:52:26,656 --> 01:52:30,159
I can see that, Haig

1722
01:52:26,656 --> 01:52:30,159
Think I'm blind

1723
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:32,411
Is that what you're saying

1724
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:35,080
Am I blind, Haig

1725
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:35,080
No, sir

1726
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:38,500
What about you

1727
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:38,500
You blind

1728
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:41,545
Tell me what this is

1729
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:41,545
Last night's count.

1730
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,048
You see Dufresne's name there

1731
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,048
I sure do

1732
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,048
Right there

1733
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,048
Dufresne.

1734
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:51,013
He was in his cell at lights out.

1735
01:52:51,181 --> 01:52:54,099
Stands to reason he'd still be here in the morning.

1736
01:52:54,434 --> 01:52:56,059
I want him found.

1737
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:59,730
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast

1738
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:59,730
Now

1739
01:52:59,981 --> 01:53:01,190
Yes, sir.

1740
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:05,986
Let's go

1741
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:05,986
Move your butts

1742
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:05,986
Move it

1743
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:08,864
Stand.

1744
01:53:10,283 --> 01:53:11,700
Well

1745
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:15,829
Well, what

1746
01:53:15,997 --> 01:53:19,458
I see you two all the time

1747
01:53:15,997 --> 01:53:19,458
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1748
01:53:20,543 --> 01:53:22,044
He must have said something.

1749
01:53:22,754 --> 01:53:25,672
No, sir, warden

1750
01:53:22,754 --> 01:53:25,672
Not a word.

1751
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:30,052
Lord, it's a miracle

1752
01:53:30,637 --> 01:53:33,222
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1753
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:35,057
Nothing left

1754
01:53:35,892 --> 01:53:38,602
but some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1755
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:41,563
And that cupcake on the wall

1756
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:41,563
Let's ask her.

1757
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:43,524
Maybe she knows.

1758
01:53:43,733 --> 01:53:46,485
What say there, fuzzy britches

1759
01:53:43,733 --> 01:53:46,485
Feel like talking

1760
01:53:47,904 --> 01:53:49,238
Guess not.

1761
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:51,990
Why should she be any different

1762
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:54,743
This is a conspiracy.

1763
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:57,079
That's what this is.

1764
01:53:57,789 --> 01:54:01,542
One big, damn conspiracy

1765
01:54:01,793 --> 01:54:03,794
And everyone's in on it

1766
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:05,587
Including her

1767
01:54:40,623 --> 01:54:44,960
In 1966..

1768
01:54:40,623 --> 01:54:44,960
Andy Dufresne escaped

1769
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:46,712
from Shawshank Prison.

1770
01:54:48,965 --> 01:54:51,508
All they found was a muddy set of prison clothes

1771
01:54:52,135 --> 01:54:55,470
a bar of soap..

1772
01:54:52,135 --> 01:54:55,470
and an old rock hammer

1773
01:54:55,638 --> 01:54:58,140
damn near worn down to the nub.

1774
01:55:02,645 --> 01:55:07,399
I remember thinking it would take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1775
01:55:08,026 --> 01:55:10,652
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1776
01:55:28,963 --> 01:55:31,256
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1777
01:55:32,008 --> 01:55:35,177
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

1778
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:37,429
An ice age here

1779
01:55:37,847 --> 01:55:40,349
million years of mountain building there.

1780
01:55:41,351 --> 01:55:44,186
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1781
01:55:45,021 --> 01:55:47,022
That's all it takes, really.

1782
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:49,066
Pressure

1783
01:55:49,525 --> 01:55:51,026
and time.

1784
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:54,196
That and a big goddamn poster.

1785
01:55:57,992 --> 01:55:59,159
Like I said

1786
01:55:59,661 --> 01:56:03,664
in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.

1787
01:56:06,459 --> 01:56:11,254
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard

1788
01:56:11,798 --> 01:56:13,715
a handful at a time.

1789
01:56:15,051 --> 01:56:17,094
I guess after Tommy was killed

1790
01:56:17,303 --> 01:56:20,263
Andy decided he'd been here long enough.

1791
01:56:20,473 --> 01:56:23,058
Lickety split

1792
01:56:20,473 --> 01:56:23,058
I want to get home.

1793
01:56:23,768 --> 01:56:25,811
I'm just about finished, sir.

1794
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:49,209
Three deposits tonight.

1795
01:56:56,509 --> 01:56:58,802
Andy did like he was told.

1796
01:56:59,012 --> 01:57:02,514
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

1797
01:57:06,185 --> 01:57:08,478
The guards simply didn't notice.

1798
01:57:08,771 --> 01:57:10,272
Neither did I.

1799
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:11,982
I mean, seriously

1800
01:57:12,191 --> 01:57:15,193
how often do you really look at a man's shoes

1801
01:59:18,734 --> 01:59:21,903
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards

1802
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:25,490
of shit smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1803
01:59:26,492 --> 01:59:28,827
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1804
01:59:33,249 --> 01:59:35,584
Five hundred yards.

1805
01:59:36,085 --> 01:59:39,171
That's the length of five football fields.

1806
01:59:39,797 --> 01:59:42,382
Just shy of half a mile.

1807
02:00:37,605 --> 02:00:42,192
The next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret

1808
02:00:42,485 --> 02:00:45,320
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

1809
02:00:45,571 --> 02:00:48,156
strolled into the Maine National Bank.

1810
02:00:48,741 --> 02:00:51,910
Until that moment, he didn't exist.

1811
02:00:52,495 --> 02:00:54,829
Except on paper

1812
02:00:52,495 --> 02:00:54,829
May I help you

1813
02:00:55,248 --> 02:00:57,165
He had all the proper ID

1814
02:00:57,375 --> 02:01:01,086
Driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card.

1815
02:01:01,504 --> 02:01:04,047
And the signature was a spot on match.

1816
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:07,342
I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.

1817
02:01:07,551 --> 02:01:09,302
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1818
02:01:10,096 --> 02:01:11,680
Thank you.

1819
02:01:11,847 --> 02:01:13,014
I'm sure I will.

1820
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:17,269
Here's your cashier's check, sir

1821
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:17,269
Will there be anything else

1822
02:01:17,478 --> 02:01:18,478
Please.

1823
02:01:19,021 --> 02:01:21,523
Would you add this to your outgoing mail

1824
02:01:22,024 --> 02:01:23,566
I'd be happy to.

1825
02:01:25,027 --> 02:01:26,361
Good day, sir.

1826
02:01:27,321 --> 02:01:31,741
Ms Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.

1827
02:01:32,201 --> 02:01:33,827
All told, he blew town

1828
02:01:34,036 --> 02:01:38,873
with better than $370,000 of Warden Norton's money.

1829
02:01:39,542 --> 02:01:42,335
Severance pay for 19 years.

1830
02:01:49,552 --> 02:01:51,761
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1831
02:02:44,607 --> 02:02:47,567
Byron Hadley

1832
02:02:44,607 --> 02:02:47,567
You have the right to remain silent.

1833
02:02:47,818 --> 02:02:52,280
If you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.

1834
02:02:52,698 --> 02:02:57,160
I wasn't there to see it, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl

1835
02:02:57,370 --> 02:02:58,870
when they took him away.

1836
02:03:04,752 --> 02:03:08,129
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1837
02:03:24,105 --> 02:03:25,480
Samuel Norton.

1838
02:03:25,648 --> 02:03:28,066
We have a warrant for your arrest

1839
02:03:25,648 --> 02:03:28,066
Open up.

1840
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:34,280
Open the door.

1841
02:03:34,448 --> 02:03:35,698
I'm not sure which key.

1842
02:03:45,835 --> 02:03:47,794
Make it easy on yourself, Norton

1843
02:03:59,306 --> 02:04:02,767
I like to think the last thing that went through his head

1844
02:04:02,977 --> 02:04:04,561
other than that bullet

1845
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:09,190
was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1846
02:04:11,694 --> 02:04:15,196
Not long after the warden deprived us of his company

1847
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:17,532
I got a postcard in the mail.

1848
02:04:18,993 --> 02:04:21,828
It was blank, but the postmark said

1849
02:04:22,037 --> 02:04:24,164
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1850
02:04:24,707 --> 02:04:26,040
Fort Hancock

1851
02:04:26,333 --> 02:04:28,042
right on the border.

1852
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:30,462
That's where Andy crossed.

1853
02:04:31,046 --> 02:04:35,175
When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down

1854
02:04:35,509 --> 02:04:37,719
it always makes me laugh.

1855
02:04:39,555 --> 02:04:41,139
Andy Dufresne

1856
02:04:41,515 --> 02:04:43,558
who crawled through a river of shit

1857
02:04:43,726 --> 02:04:46,144
and came out clean on the other side.

1858
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:48,354
Andy Dufresne

1859
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:50,732
headed for the Pacific.

1860
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:55,904
Hadley's got him by the throat, right

1861
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:55,904
He says, I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident.

1862
02:05:00,075 --> 02:05:02,952
Those of us who knew him best talk about him often.

1863
02:05:03,621 --> 02:05:05,330
I swear, the stuff he pulled..

1864
02:05:03,621 --> 02:05:05,330
My friends could use a couple of beers.

1865
02:05:08,834 --> 02:05:10,502
And he got it

1866
02:05:11,754 --> 02:05:14,130
Sometimes it makes me sad, though

1867
02:05:14,423 --> 02:05:15,840
Andy being gone.

1868
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:20,678
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1869
02:05:21,138 --> 02:05:23,223
Their feathers are just too bright.

1870
02:05:24,934 --> 02:05:26,643
And when they fly away

1871
02:05:27,102 --> 02:05:31,481
the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1872
02:05:32,566 --> 02:05:33,816
But still

1873
02:05:34,276 --> 02:05:38,613
the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.

1874
02:05:42,826 --> 02:05:45,203
I guess I just miss my friend.

1875
02:06:09,645 --> 02:06:10,812
Please sit down.

1876
02:06:16,652 --> 02:06:18,236
Ellis Boyd Redding

1877
02:06:18,779 --> 02:06:22,031
your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.

1878
02:06:22,825 --> 02:06:24,993
You feel you've been rehabilitated

1879
02:06:26,829 --> 02:06:28,413
Rehabilitated

1880
02:06:30,457 --> 02:06:32,333
Well, now, let me see.

1881
02:06:33,335 --> 02:06:35,670
I don't have any idea what that means.

1882
02:06:37,798 --> 02:06:40,049
It means you're ready to rejoin society

1883
02:06:40,634 --> 02:06:42,969
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1884
02:06:45,139 --> 02:06:47,140
To me it's just a made up word.

1885
02:06:48,475 --> 02:06:50,810
A politician's word so that

1886
02:06:51,228 --> 02:06:54,772
young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie

1887
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:56,858
and have a job.

1888
02:06:58,819 --> 02:07:00,903
What do you really want to know

1889
02:07:01,697 --> 02:07:03,656
Am I sorry for what I did

1890
02:07:04,074 --> 02:07:05,366
Well, are you

1891
02:07:07,161 --> 02:07:09,996
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1892
02:07:11,373 --> 02:07:14,834
Not because I'm in here or because you think I should.

1893
02:07:18,297 --> 02:07:20,882
I look back on the way I was then

1894
02:07:23,010 --> 02:07:24,344
a young

1895
02:07:25,262 --> 02:07:28,765
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1896
02:07:31,769 --> 02:07:33,478
I want to talk to him.

1897
02:07:35,397 --> 02:07:37,899
I want to try and talk some sense to him.

1898
02:07:38,609 --> 02:07:40,568
Tell him the way things are.

1899
02:07:42,655 --> 02:07:44,072
But I can't.

1900
02:07:46,283 --> 02:07:48,284
That kid's long gone

1901
02:07:49,495 --> 02:07:52,246
and this old man is all that's left.

1902
02:07:53,666 --> 02:07:55,124
I got to live with that.

1903
02:07:56,502 --> 02:07:58,211
Rehabilitated

1904
02:07:58,587 --> 02:08:00,421
It's just a bullshit word.

1905
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:06,094
So you go on and stamp your forms, sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1906
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:09,597
Because to tell you the truth

1907
02:08:09,932 --> 02:08:11,933
I don't give a shit.

1908
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:39,854
Here you go, miss.

1909
02:09:42,816 --> 02:09:43,858
Restroom break

1910
02:09:49,656 --> 02:09:54,202
You don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss

1911
02:09:49,656 --> 02:09:54,202
Just go.

1912
02:09:55,204 --> 02:09:56,829
Yes, sir.

1913
02:10:07,216 --> 02:10:10,301
Forty years I've been asking permission to piss.

1914
02:10:11,136 --> 02:10:14,138
I can't squeeze a drop without say so.

1915
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:19,811
There's a harsh truth to face.

1916
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:24,398
No way I'm going to make it on the outside.

1917
02:10:32,241 --> 02:10:35,952
All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole

1918
02:10:36,745 --> 02:10:39,247
so maybe they'd send me back.

1919
02:10:44,419 --> 02:10:46,879
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1920
02:10:47,756 --> 02:10:49,423
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1921
02:10:49,633 --> 02:10:51,592
Knew it all too well.

1922
02:10:53,178 --> 02:10:56,597
All I want is to be back where things make sense.

1923
02:10:57,015 --> 02:10:59,767
Where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1924
02:11:01,770 --> 02:11:04,105
Only one thing stops me.

1925
02:11:05,566 --> 02:11:07,942
A promise I made to Andy.

1926
02:11:28,463 --> 02:11:29,797
There it is.

1927
02:11:40,225 --> 02:11:41,893
Much obliged, sir

1928
02:11:40,225 --> 02:11:41,893
Dear Red:

1929
02:15:22,697 --> 02:15:25,199
If you're reading this, you've gotten out

1930
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:29,537
and if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a bit further.

1931
02:15:29,704 --> 02:15:32,206
You remember the name of the town, don't you

1932
02:15:34,501 --> 02:15:36,001
Zihuatanejo.

1933
02:15:37,629 --> 02:15:41,215
I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.

1934
02:15:41,716 --> 02:15:45,261
I'll keep an eye out for you, and the chessboard ready.

1935
02:15:46,054 --> 02:15:47,471
Remember, Red

1936
02:15:47,806 --> 02:15:49,890
hope is a good thing

1937
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:52,101
maybe the best of things.

1938
02:15:52,310 --> 02:15:54,478
And no good thing ever dies.

1939
02:15:55,021 --> 02:15:57,898
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

1940
02:15:58,066 --> 02:15:59,817
and finds you well.

1941
02:16:00,318 --> 02:16:02,903
Your friend..

1942
02:16:00,318 --> 02:16:02,903
Andy

1943
02:16:00,318 --> 02:16:02,903
Get busy living..

1944
02:16:00,318 --> 02:16:02,903
or get busy dying.

1945
02:16:43,278 --> 02:16:45,446
That's goddamn right.

1946
02:16:50,702 --> 02:16:52,828
For the second time in my life

1947
02:16:53,079 --> 02:16:55,623
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1948
02:16:56,708 --> 02:16:58,626
Parole violation.

1949
02:16:59,294 --> 02:17:02,963
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.

1950
02:17:03,632 --> 02:17:05,674
Not for an old crook like me.

1951
02:17:05,884 --> 02:17:07,927
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1952
02:17:11,598 --> 02:17:16,310
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1953
02:17:16,770 --> 02:17:20,105
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.

1954
02:17:20,315 --> 02:17:22,816
A free man at the start of a long journey

1955
02:17:22,984 --> 02:17:25,611
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1956
02:17:28,615 --> 02:17:31,283
I hope I can make it across the border.

1957
02:17:32,786 --> 02:17:35,829
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1958
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:41,752
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.

1959
02:17:43,588 --> 02:17:44,797
I hope.
